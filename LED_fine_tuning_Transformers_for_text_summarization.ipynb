        "\n",
        "* Transforms complex financial terminology into understandable concepts (Liu et al., 2022)\n",
        "* Connects related information scattered across documents\n",
        "* Reveals implications not explicitly stated in the original text (Liu et al., 2022)\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is essential because financial content presents unique challenges. Dense reports filled with numbers and jargon need interpretation, not just condensation (Bloomberg, 2024). An extractive summary might state \"Q3 revenue increased 4.2%,\" while an abstractive version explains \"The company shows steady growth despite market challenges, continuing previous quarters' positive trend.\" The best financial summaries deliver both the essence and implications in accessible language, helping readers grasp what truly matters without navigating technical complexities (Liu et al., 2022). They transform financial language into insights that drive better decisions, making complex information immediately useful — performance that can be quantitatively assessed using evaluation metrics such as ROUGE (Barbella and Tortora, 2022)."

Therefore, we decided to fine-tune `led-large-book-summary` (based on allenai/led-large-16384) on the BookSum dataset (`kmfoda/booksum`), which handles up to 16,384 tokens .

            " FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Digerati Technologies, Inc. San Antonio, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digerati Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Digerati”) as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Digerati’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Digerati is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Digerati’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Digerati as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Digerati will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Digerati suffered losses from operations and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP Houston, Texas October 24, 2016 PART 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In thousands) See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements DIGERATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business. Digerati Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Digerati”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 24, 2004. Digerati is a diversified holding company that has no independent operations apart from its subsidiaries. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shift8 Technologies, Inc., we are an established cloud telephony service provider that offers a comprehensive suite of cloud communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost effective communication solutions. Unlike legacy phone systems, our telephony services are delivered Only in the Cloud ™, or over the Internet, making service available to customers from anywhere internet access is available. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati In accordance with ASC 810-10-05. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Reclassifications. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year for comparative purposes. Use of Estimates. In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it’s exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition. Digerati derives revenue from two product offerings Global VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining. Digerati records and reports its revenue on the gross amount billed to its customers in accordance with the following indicators: ●Digerati is the primary obligor in its arrangements, ●Digerati has latitude in establishing pricing, ●Digerati changes the product or performs part of the service and is involved in the determination of the product or service specifications, ●Digerati has discretion in supplier selection and ●Digerati assumes credit risk for the amount billed to the customer. Sources of revenue: Global VoIP Services: We currently provide VoIP communication services to U.S. and foreign telecommunications companies that lack transmission facilities, require additional capacity or do not have the regulatory licenses to terminate traffic in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Typically, these telecommunications companies offer their services to the public for domestic and international long distance services Cloud Communication Services: We provide cloud communication services to value-added resellers and enterprise customers. The service includes fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, prepaid services, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment for specialized applications. Cost of Services: Global VoIP Services: We incur transmission and termination charges from our suppliers and the providers of the infrastructure and network. The cost is based on rate per minute, volume of minutes transported and terminated through the network. Additionally, we incur fixed Internet bandwidth charges and per minute billing charges. In some cases we incur installation charges from certain carriers. These installation costs are passed on to our customers for the connection to our VoIP network. Cloud Communication Services: We incur bandwidth, licensing, and co-location charges in connection with cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connection between our customers to allow them access to our services. Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Bad debt expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, Digerati’s allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $0 and $0, respectively. Property and equipment. Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one to five years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Digerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value. Derivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments, Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. Income taxes. Digerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Since January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Currently, we have $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of July 31, 2015. Stock-based compensation. Digerati accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions on share-based payments which require measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Basic and diluted net loss per share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the year ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Our derivative liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and were valued using Level 3 inputs. Recently issued accounting pronouncements. Digerati does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on Digerati’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN Financial Condition Digerati’s consolidated financial statements for the year ending July 31, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $78,076,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $2,516,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such additional funding from various possible sources, including the public equity market, private financings, sales of assets, collaborative arrangements and debt. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to delay or reduce the scope of its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due. The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern. Digerati’s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2016 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digerati’s plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3 - CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION On May 30, 2013, Digerati Technologies, Inc., Debtor in Possession (“Digerati”) filed a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”), Case No. 13-33264 (the “Bankruptcy”). Digerati filed the petition seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for the primary purpose of streamlining litigation. On April 4, 2014 (the “Confirmation Date”), the Bankruptcy Court entered an Agreed Order Confirming Joint Plan of Reorganization Filed by Plan Proponents (“Agreed Order”) confirming the Plan Proponents’ Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization as modified on the record on April 4, 2014 and/or as modified by the Agreed Order (the “Reorganization Plan”). As used herein, the term “Reorganized Debtor” refers to Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, after the Confirmation Date and as reorganized by the Reorganization Plan. Summary of the Plan This summary is not intended to be a complete description of the Reorganization Plan, and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreed Order, Reorganization Plan, Plan Supplement and Disclosure Statement. A copy of the Agreed Order and Reorganization Plan were filed as exhibits to Digerati’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2014. (a)The Agreed Order provided final approval of the Disclosure Statement, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to Digerati’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 23, 2014. (b)Upon the Confirmation Date, the Reorganized Debtor had 1,977,626 shares of common stock outstanding. All outstanding shares of Digerati’s preferred stock, warrants, options, conversion rights and other rights to acquire shares of common stock and all “super voting” shares were cancelled. (c)The Reorganized Debtor’s Board of Directors consisted of Messrs. Arthur L. Smith, William E. McIlwain and James J. Davis. The Reorganized Debtor’s officers, who served at the discretion of the board of directors until the Stockholder Meeting, were: Arthur L. Smith President and Chief Executive Officer Antonio Estrada Jr. Chief Financial Officer Subsequently, on September 15, 2014, the Company held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and at the discretion of the new directors, Mr. Smith and Mr. Estrada continued to serve as officers of the Reorganized Debtor. (d)The Reorganized Debtor was required to hold a Stockholder Meeting to elect a new board of directors after August 31, 2014, and before September 15, 2014. The Reorganized Debtor’s officers and directors, as well as the parties to the BSA and a Rule 11 Mediated Settlement Agreement dated January 14, 2014 (the “Rule 11 Agreement”), were not eligible for election to the new board of directors at the Stockholder Meeting. Messrs. Smith and Estrada were not permitted to solicit proxies in connection with the Stockholder Meeting but were allowed to vote shares of common stock owned by them. Subsequently, on September 15, 2014, the Company held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and new directors were elected. (e)Under the Reorganization Plan title to the issued and outstanding shares of Dishon Disposal, Inc., a North Dakota corporation (“Dishon”), and Hurley Enterprises, Inc., a Montana corporation (“Hurley”), owned by Digerati were transferred to a Grantor Trust subject to existing liens and the Rule 11 Agreement. The Dishon and Hurley shares did not vest in the Reorganized Debtor and remained the property of Digerati’s bankruptcy estate. Additionally, under the Reorganization Plan certain retained litigation claims were transferred to the Grantor Trust. The beneficiary of the Grantor Trust is the Reorganized Debtor. The trustee and Disbursing Agent of the Grantor Trust is Mr. William R. Greendyke. All other assets of Digerati that are not transferred to the Grantor Trust and/or retained by Digerati vested in the Reorganized Debtor as of the Confirmation Date, including but not limited to the common stock of Shift8 Technologies, Inc., free and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances. (f)All of the issued and outstanding shares of Dishon and Hurley were sold by the Grantor Trust and the proceeds from the sale were distributed by the trustee and Disbursing Agent to discharge certain allowed claims. The claims distribution set forth in the Reorganization Plan were as follows: (i)Allowed priority claims were paid in full from cash on hand. (ii)Allowed administrative claims will be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the Dishon and Hurley shares except for those amounts paid pursuant to the budget attached to the Reorganization Plan. The Company estimated the maximum potential amount of any federal income tax liability on the gains derived from the sale of the Dishon and Hurley shares and deposited that amount into a reserve account until determination of the actual taxes due. (iii)Proceeds from the sale of the Dishon shares in excess of $1,250,000 plus one-half of Digerati’s unpaid professional fees (the “Dishon Carve Out”) and amount reserved for taxes were delivered to creditors holding $30,000,000 of Digerati’s indebtedness secured by the Dishon shares, up to the principal of and accrued interest on such indebtedness. In addition, the secured creditors maintain a right to seek a refund if the estimated amount withheld for taxes on the sale of the Dishon shares exceeds the tax obligation. (iv)Proceeds from the sale of the Hurley shares in excess of $1,250,000 plus one-half of Digerati’s unpaid professional fees (the “Hurley Carve Out”) and amount reserved for taxes were delivered to creditors holding $30,000,000 of Digerati’s indebtedness secured by the Hurley shares, up to the principal of and accrued interest on such indebtedness. In addition, the secured creditors maintain a right to seek a refund if the estimated amount withheld for taxes on the sale of the Hurley shares exceeds the tax obligation. Principal of or interest on Digerati’s indebtedness secured by the Hurley shares that is in excess of the net proceeds from the sale of Hurley shares has been waived. (v)Allowed unsecured claims of $1,000 or less were paid in full from cash on hand. (vi)Allowed unsecured claims greater than $1,000 were paid in full from the Dishon Carve Out and the Hurley Carve Out. The excess from the combined $2,500,000 withheld from the sale of the Dishon shares and Hurley shares will be applied to the unpaid professional fees. (vii)All cure payments under assumed contracts were paid within 90 days of April 4, 2014. (viii)All executory contracts of Digerati were rejected except as previously assumed by order in the Bankruptcy Court or specifically listed as assumed in the Reorganization Plan. (ix)The Reorganized Debtor released Messrs. Arthur L. Smith, Antonio Estrada, William E. McIlwain and James J. Davis in their individual capacity and their respective capacities as officers and/or directors, as applicable, of Digerati, Hurley or Dishon of all claims and causes of action that arise on or before the Confirmation Date that could be asserted by Digerati, the estate and/or on account of the Bankruptcy through the Stockholder Meeting. The Reorganized Debtor also released Messrs. Arthur L. Smith, William McIlwain and James Davis to the greatest extent provided by law from any claims. (x)The Reorganization Plan became effective on December 31, 2014. NOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS During fiscal 2008, Digerati made a loan of $150,000 to NetSapiens Inc. The note receivable had a maturity date of June 26, 2008 with interest at 8% per year. The note was secured by NetSapiens’ proprietary Starter Platform License and SNAPsolution modules. On June 26, 2008 Digerati converted the outstanding interest and principal balance into a lifetime and perpetual NetSapiens’ License. The License provides Digerati with the ability to offer Hosted PBX (Private Branch eXchange), IP Centrex application, prepaid calling, call center, conferencing, messaging and other innovative telephony functionality necessary to offer standard and/or custom services to the Residential and Enterprise markets. The NetSapiens’ License is being amortized equally over a period of 10 years. NOTE 5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Following is a summary of Digerati’s property and equipment at July 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): For the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $18,000 and $17,000, respectively. NOTE 6 - DEBT At July 31, 2016 and 2015, outstanding debt consisted of the following: (In thousands). In November 2013, Shift8 Networks, Inc., an operating subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a note payable with Mr. Arthur L. Smith, in the amount of $46,755. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of February 28, 2014. Subsequently, Mr. Smith agreed to extend the maturity date of the promissory note to November 30, 2014 and later agreed to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2015. On January 31, 2015, Shift8 Networks and Mr. Smith agreed to renew and extend the maturity date on the promissory note to October 31, 2015. The renewed note had an implied annual interest rate of 3%. On October 9, 2015 Shift8 Networks paid off the total outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. On August 21, 2015 the Company entered into a short term promissory note payable for $25,000 with Craig K. Clement, the Company’s Chairman of the Board. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of October 31, 2015. On October 15, 2015 the Company paid off the total outstanding principal balance. NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES Digerati files a consolidated tax return. The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2016, Digerati had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,023,000 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities. Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: The effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows: Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2016 and 2015: At July 31, 2016, realization of Digerati’s deferred tax assets was not considered likely to be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for 2016 was approximately $6,075,000. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digerati’s combined financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. As a result of the reverse split in 2013 outstanding common shares was 1,977,626 as of July 31, 2014 and the sale of 2,279,412 common shares in January 2015 resulted in a change of control and the net operation loss became subject to the separate return limitation year, thus the net operating loss was reduced. The Company files a calendar year return and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Currently, we have $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2016. NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments Digerati leases its office space with monthly payments of $580; the lease is on a month to month basis. The annual rent expense under the operating lease was $7,740 and $8,715 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The future minimum lease payment under the operating lease for fiscal year 2017 is $6,960. Contingencies On May 1, 2014, Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP, Rainmaker Ventures II, Ltd and WEM Equity Capital investments, Ltd. filed an arbitration claim pursuant to the Bankruptcy Settlement Agreement. On July 19, 2014, the arbitrator entered a decision that Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP was entitled to the transfer of 20,600 shares of Digerati Common Stock that were outstanding as of the date of the November Transactions and reflected on Digerati's stockholder list as being held by other stockholders who were principals of Recap Marketing & Consulting, LLP. Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP and Rainmaker Ventures II, Ltd. subsequently challenged the findings of the arbitrator by filing a motion to vacate in In Re Digerati Technologies, Inc. On November 23, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the motion vacate. From time to time Digerati is involved in various litigations in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s management believes existing litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of Digerati. NOTE 9 - STOCK -BASED COMPENSATION In November 2015, Digerati adopted the Digerati Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan, authorizes the grant of up to 7.5 million stock options, restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain other persons. The Plan is intended to permit Digerati to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall success of Digerati. Digerati’s Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted common stock and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant. During the period ended July 31, 2016, we issued: -121,135 common shares to various employees as part of the Company’s profit sharing plan contribution. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22,000 equivalent to the value of the shares calculated based on the share’s closing price at the grant dates. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, Digerati did not have any outstanding options under the Plan. Unamortized compensation cost totaled $0 at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015. NOTE 10 - WARRANTS During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company executed a stock purchase agreement with Flagship Oil and Gas Corp. for the sale of 2,279,412 shares of Digerati Common Stock, and warrants for the purchase of an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.14 per share for five years. In consideration for the shares and the warrants, the Company received a promissory note in the original principal amount of $310,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.0% per annum, payable in installments of $40,000 plus accrued interest on January 31, 2015; $60,000 plus accrued interest on February 13, 2015; and $210,000 plus accrued interest on March 6, 2015. The Black-Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the relative fair value of the 300,000 warrants issued during the period, using the assumptions of a risk free interest rate of 1.37%, dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 312%, and an expected life of 5 years. The warrants have a relative fair value of approximately $34,627 and included in additional paid-in capital. A summary of the warrants as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 and the changes during the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 are presented below: NOTE 11 - NON-STANDARDIZED PROFIT SHARING PLAN We currently provide a Non-Standardized Profit Sharing Plan, adopted September 15, 2006. Under the plan our employees qualify to participate in the plan after one year of employment. Contributions under the plan are based on 25% of the annual base salary of each eligible employee up to $46,000 per year. Contributions under the plan are fully vested upon funding. During the years ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, the Company issued 121,135 and 492,356, respectively, common shares to various employees as part of the Company’s profit sharing plan contribution. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 of $22,000 and $118,165, respectively, equivalent to the value of the shares calculated based on the share’s closing price at the grant dates. NOTE 12 - SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company derived a significant amount of revenue from four customers, comprising 26%, 19%, 16%, and 13% of the total revenue for the period, respectively, compared to four customers, comprising 20%, 15%, 12%, and 10% of the total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2015. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company derived a significant amount of accounts receivable from one customer, comprising 68% of the total accounts receivable for the period, compared to one customer, comprising 75% of the total accounts receivable for the year ended July 31, 2015. NOTE 13 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In November 2013, Shift8 Networks, Inc., an operating subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a note payable with Mr. Arthur L. Smith, in the amount of $46,755. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of February 28, 2014. Subsequently, Mr. Smith agreed to extend the maturity date of the promissory note to November 30, 2014 and later agreed to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2015. On January 31, 2015, Shift8 Networks and Mr. Smith agreed to renew and extend the maturity date on the promissory note to October 31, 2015. The renewed note had an implied annual interest rate of 3%. On October 9, 2015 Shift8 Networks paid off the total outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company executed a stock purchase agreement with Flagship Oil and Gas Corp. for the sale of 2,279,412 shares of Digerati Common Stock, and warrants for the purchase of an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.14 per share for five years. In consideration for the shares and the warrants, the Company received a promissory note in the original principal amount of $310,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.0% per annum, payable in installments of $40,000 plus accrued interest on January 31, 2015; $60,000 plus accrued interest on February 13, 2015; and $210,000 plus accrued interest on March 6, 2015. The Black-Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the relative fair value of the 300,000 warrants issued during the period, using the assumptions of a risk free interest rate of 1.37%, dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 312%, and an expected life of five years. The warrants have a relative fair value of approximately $34,627 and included in additional paid-in capital. On August 14, 2015, Flagship Oil and Gas Corp. paid $36,065 to the Company for the remaining principal balance and accrued interest associated with the Flagship Notes.

NOTE 14 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND JOINT OPERATING AGREEMENT On February 29, 2016 Flagship Energy Company (\"Flagship\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with a Texas-based contract-for-hire oil and gas operator (“Operator”). Under the PSA, Flagship has utilized Operator for the drilling, completion and initial operations of a shallow oil and gas well in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of Operator’s working interest and 80% of its Net Revenue Interest. Under the PSA, the Operator has agreed to transfer all field-level operations and assign 100% of a certain oil, gas and mineral lease to Flagship upon demand, which includes a tract of land located in South Texas. Additionally, Flagship entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\") with Operator, whereby the parties agree to develop the oil and gas well or wells for the production and retrieval of oil and gas commodities as provided for in the oil, gas and mineral lease.

            " To the Board of Directors Sense Technologies, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sense Technologies, Inc. as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements of Sense Technologies, Inc. referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sense Technologies, Inc. as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods described above in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company suffered a net loss from operations and has negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /S/ M&K CPAS, PLLC August 12, 2016 Houston, Texas www.mkacpas.com SENSE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Background The Company was incorporated pursuant to the British Columbia Companies Act on May 25, 1988 as Graham Gold Mining Corporation. On October 27, 1997, the Company changed its name to Sense Technologies Inc. and on December 14, 2001, the Company was continued in the Yukon Territory, Canada and during the year ended February 29, 2008, the Company changed its jurisdiction of organization from the Yukon Territory back to British Columbia, Canada. The Company holds a non-exclusive license to manufacture, distribute, market and sell the ScopeOut® product, a system of specially designed mirrors which are placed at specific points on automobiles, trucks, sport utility vehicles or commercial vehicles to offer drivers a more complete view behind the vehicle. During the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, the Company had assets and generated sales primarily in the United States of America. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuations, asset impairment, stock based compensation and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We had $1,298 cash equivalents at February 29, 2016 and no cash equivalents at February 28, 2015. Basis of Presentation The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary of a fair presentation have been included. Accounts Receivable Accounts Receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect from the outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based upon its assessment of the current collection status of individual accounts. Delinquent amounts that are outstanding after management has conducted reasonable collection efforts are written of through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Total Allowance for Doubtful Accounts during the years ended 2016 and 2015 was $Nil and $Nil, respectively. The net Accounts Receivable is $36,675 at February 29, 2016 and $nil at February 28, 2015, respectively. No balances were due from related parties. Inventory Inventory consists of finished goods which are recorded at the lower of average cost and net realizable value. Average cost is determined using the weighted-average method and includes invoice cost, duties and freight where applicable plus direct labor applied to the product and an applicable share of manufacturing overhead. A provision for obsolescence for slow moving inventory items is estimated by management based on historical and expected future sales and is included in cost of goods sold. Inventory was expensed at year-end as the Company did not have title or access. Prepaid Royalties Prepaid royalties consist of guaranteed royalties the company has paid but for which sales have not yet been completed. Royalty expense that will not be recognized in the next year is classified as long-term. On December 31, 2011, the Company issued a promissory note for $189,000 for guaranteed royalty payments due under the Escort licensing agreement. Due to limited cash flows to insure the payment of this note, an impairment equal to the promissory note has been recorded. All prepaid royalties are considered impaired at February 29, 2016, due to the uncertainty of future sales. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method and the declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the original estimated economic useful lives of the applicable assets are capitalized. Expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Foreign Currency Transactions The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the fiscal year-end rate of exchange. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at historic rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the month of transaction. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, goods are shipped and title passes, collection is probable, and the fee is fixed or determinable. Provisions are established for estimated product returns and warranty costs at the time the revenue is recognized. The Company records deferred revenue when cash is received in advance of the revenue recognition criteria being met. Credit Risk Sense Technologies does not require collateral from its customers with respect to accounts receivable. Sense determines any required allowance by considering a number of factors including lengths of time accounts receivable are past due. Reserves for accounts receivable are made when accounts become uncollectible. Payments subsequently received are credited to allowance for doubtful accounts. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective income tax bases and for loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. Deferred income tax assets are evaluated and if their realization is not considered to be \"more likely than not\", a valuation allowance is provided. (Loss) Per Share The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with FASB literature. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the year including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the year is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the year ended February 29, 2016, potentially dilutive common shares relating to options, convertible promissory notes payable and convertible preferred shares outstanding totaling 4,957,199 (February 28, 2015 - 4,957,199) were not included in the computation of loss per share because the effect was anti-dilutive. Product Warranty The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty on product quality and accrues for known warranty if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues for estimated incurred based on historical activity. The accrual and the related expense for known issues were not significant during the periods presented. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the costs of advertisements and marketing at the time the expenditure occurs, and expenses the costs of communicating advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or airtime is used. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are continually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Stock-Based Compensation The Company is required to record compensation expense, based on the fair value of the awards, for all awards granted after the date of the adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding as at the date of adoption. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. For employees, the compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which approximates the vesting period. Compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees is amortized over the contract services period or, if none exists, from the date of grant until the options vest. Compensation associated with unvested options granted to non-employees is re-measured on each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, advances payable, dividends payable and promissory notes payable approximate fair value because of the demand or short-term maturity of those instruments. The carrying value of the convertible promissory notes payable also approximates fair value. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The Company discloses the assets and liabilities that are recognized and measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, presented in a three-tier fair value hierarchy, as follows: · Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; · Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and · Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The following schedule summaries the gross value of assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a non-recurring basis at February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015: There were no gains or losses in fair value during the years ended February 29, 2016 or February 28, 2015. Reclassification Certain amounts reported in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to the current period presentation. Recently Adopted and Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) (“ASU 2015-16”). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (“ASU 2015-14”). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) (“ASU 2015-03”), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets. On November 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-16-Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this Update do not change the current criteria in GAAP for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. On November 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-17-Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this Update provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18, 2014. After the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. On August 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concerns (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. The new guidance requires that share-based compensation that require a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities August apply the amendments in this Update either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10: Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation , to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities, thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception August change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-10 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN At February 29, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had an accumulated deficit of $21,650,457 (February 28, 2015 - $21,047,354) since its inception and incurred a net loss of $571,512 (February 28, 2015 - $746,203) for the year and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or from related party. Management expects the Company’s cash requirement over the twelve-month period ended February 28, 2017 to be $300,000. While the Company is expending its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds for operations. NOTE 3 - PREPAID EXPENSES As of February 29, 2016, included in prepaid expenses is $12,970 (February 28, 2015: $27,134) for an insurance premium for the directors of the Company financed through Flatiron Capital. The insurance policy is from August 23, 2015 to August 23, 2016. NOTE 4 - ACCRUED EXPENSES/ACCRUED EXPENSES - RELATED PARTY Other liabilities and accrued expenses consisted of the following: As of February 29, 2016, included in the $35,884 of accounts payable to related parties is $33,495 (February 28, 2015: $33,495) and $2,389 (February 28, 2015: $2,389) owing to directors of the Company, an accounting firm in which a director of the Company is a partner and a company controlled by the Company’s President and a director with respect to unpaid fees, purchases and expenses, $480,000 (February 28, 2015: $480,000) owing to stockholders of the Company in respect of royalties payable and $53,694 (February 28, 2015: $53,694) owing to the former president of the Company in respect of unpaid wages. At February 29, 2016, advances payable of $60,158 (February 28, 2015: $76,100) are due to a company controlled by a director of the Company. At February 29, 2016, promissory notes payable of $439,590 (February 28, 2015: $439,590) is due to a profit sharing and retirement plan which is administered by a director of the Company. The accounts payable and advances payable are unsecured, non-interest bearing and have no specific terms of repayment. Sense Technologies, Inc. plans to use the funds from sales, and if we are able to raise funds through equity issuances, to fund the payment of delinquent liabilities. NOTE 5 - ROYALTIES PAYABLE Pursuant to the licenses with ScopeOut® license called for $150,000 to be paid over two years (paid) along with a royalty of 10% of wholesale price for each ScopeOut® unit sold, but not less than $2.00 per unit. In order to maintain the exclusive license for the ScopeOut® products, in accordance with the license agreement with Palowmar Industries, LLC, we are required to pay royalties to the licensor based on the following minimum quantities of units sold: a) 30,000 units per year beginning in years 1-2 b) 60,000 units per year beginning in years 3-4 c) 100,000 units per year beginning in years 5 and above. During 2010, the Company re-negotiated the exclusive license agreement with the Scope Out® inventor. All prior minimum royalties were eliminated, and accordingly, the Company recorded $602,907 additional capital for a related party write-off. Prepaid royalties payable under the new license are $5,000 per month for twelve months commencing September 1, 2010. The new agreement also calls for a 5% royalty with a $.75 per unit maximum “minimum royalty” to retain exclusivity with the following volumes: End of calendar year containing the second anniversary: 30,000 units End of calendar year containing the third anniversary: 60,000 units End of calendar year containing the fourth anniversary: 110,000 units End of calendar year containing the fifth anniversary and thereafter: 125,000 units No royalties are currently accrued as we have not yet reached the end of the calendar year containing the second anniversary. Such “calendar year” commencing the minimum royalties to retain exclusivity is the first year within which an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and/or Tier 1 manufacturer sub-licenses the Scope Out® product. For any sub-licenses of the product, royalties are shared as follows: OEM/Tier 1 Supplier Sub Licensor: 65% Sense Technologies 35% Inventor Any other Sub-Licensor: 50% Sense Technologies 50% Inventor The current royalties accrued for Scope Out royalties are $nil and $nil as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. Pursuant to the Guardian Alert licenses, we are required to make royalty payments to the licensors and meet sales targets as follows: a) $6.00(US) per unit on the first one million units sold; b) thereafter, the greater of $4.00(US) per unit sold or 6% of the wholesale selling price on units sold; and c) 50% of any fees paid to Sense in consideration for tooling, redesign, technical or aesthetic development or, should the licensors receive a similar fee, the licensors will pay 50% to Sense. In order to retain the exclusive right to this license we incurred minimum royalty fees. Because we were unable to pay these fees, we accrued the royalties as a payable. Royalties accruals were ceased in 2004 and rights of exclusivity were forfeited. Royalties payable to Guardian Alert are $480,000 and $480,000 as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. The following table presents the changes in the accrued royalties - related party balance from February 28, 2015 to February 29, 2016: NOTE 6 - NOTES PAYABLE, CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE, AND NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY The Company is in default with respect to four of the above notes payable totaling $168,184. The Company is in default with respect to nine of the above convertible notes payable totaling $584,447 as of February 28, 2015 and February 29, 2016. Future minimum note payments as of February 29, 2016 are as follows: NOTE 7 - PREFERRED STOCK The Class A preferred shares entitle the holders thereof to cumulative dividends of $0.10 per share annually and the right to convert the preferred shares into common shares at the rate of $0.29 per share. The shares were redeemable at the option of the Company at any time after August 30, 2005 at the redemption price of $1.00 per share plus payment of unpaid dividends. Dividends on preferred shares are payable annually on July 31 of each year. During the year ended February 29, 2016, the Company accrued dividends payable of $31,591 (February 28, 2015: $31,591). Dividends are currently accruing and total $424,281 and $392,689 at February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. NOTE 8 - COMMON STOCK a) Common stock issued for cash During the year ended February 29, 2016, the company issued 150,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $45,000. For the year ended February 28, 2015, the company issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $450,000. The Company issued 733,333 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $220,000 which was received in prior years and was recorded as Common Stock Payable at February 28, 2015. The Company issued 200,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $60,000 which was received in prior years and was recorded as Common Stock Payable at February 28, 2014. The Company issued promissory notes with stock granted as an incentive. The stock was valued with relative fair value of common stock compared to fair market value of debt, common stock valued with closing price on date of agreement at $0.20. $960 recorded as a debt discount. As the debt was due on demand, the discount was fully expensed in the year ended February 29, 2016. b) Common stock for services During the year ended February 29, 2008, the Company granted an officer and a director of the Company to the right to receive 250,000 common shares for past services provided. The fair value of each common share was $0.80 on the grant date. The shares, fully vested and non-forfeitable on the grant date, were issued in 2009. This balance is presented as Common Stock as of February 28, 2010. Further, in connection with a consulting services agreement, the Company also committed to issue 111,110 common shares with fair value of $88,889, being $0.80 per share based on the quoted market price of the Company’s common shares. This balance is presented as Common Stock Payable as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. During the year ended February 29, 2016, the Company issued 100,000 common shares for consulting services. The fair value of each common share was $0.30 based on the closing trading price on the issue date and was recorded as consulting expense of $30,000. During the year ended February 28, 2015, the Company issued 15,000 common shares for consulting services. The fair value of each common share was $0.30 based on the closing trading price on the grant date and was recorded as consulting expense of $4,500. c) Common stock payable On February 24, 2016, the company received $30,000 for 150,000 shares of common stock subscription. The remaining balance of $15,000 was received in the next fiscal year. d) Options Stock-based Compensation Plan The Company has adopted a Stock Option Plan (‘the plan”) in which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors makes a determination to whom options should be granted and at what price and their terms of vesting. The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. For employees, the compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which approximates the vesting period. Compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees is amortized over the contract services period or, if none exists, from the date of grant until the options vest. Compensation associated with unvested options granted to non-employees is re-measured on each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility of options granted has been determined using the historical stock price. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise, forfeiture and employee termination within the valuation model. For non-employees, the expected term of the options approximates the full term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. Based on the best estimate, management applied the estimated forfeiture rate of Nil in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying Statement of Loss. The Company has granted directors common share purchase options. These options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. The weighted average remaining contractual life of the share purchase options at February 29, 2016 is 4 years (February 28, 2015: 4 years). For the year ended February 28, 2010, the Company granted a total of 100,000 options expiring on December 31, 2014 to the directors of the Company. These options vested at the grant date with exercise price of $0.30 per share. The fair value of these options was $0.20 per share, totaling $19,729 which was recognized as management fee in the year ended February 28, 2010. For the year ended February 28, 2011, the Company granted a total of 100,000 options expiring on December 31, 2014 to a director of the Company. These options vested at the grant date with exercise price of $0.30 per share. The fair value of these options was $0.30 per share, $19,626 was recognized as management fee in the year ended February 28, 2011. For the year ended February 28, 2013, the Company granted a total of 100,000 options expiring on December 31, 2014 to directors of the Company. These options vested at the grant date with exercise price of $0.30 per share. The fair value of these options was $0.30 per share, $26,303 was recognized as management fee in the year ended February 28, 2013. For the year ended February 28, 2015, the Company granted a total of 600,000 options expiring on December 31, 2019 to directors of the Company. These options vested at the grant date with exercise price of $0.20 per share. The fair value of these options was $0.0062 per share, $36,902 was recognized as management fee in the year ended February 28, 2015.The fair value of the options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: At February 29, 2016, the following director common share purchase options were outstanding entitling the holders thereof the right to purchase one common share for each share purchase option held: Warrants As of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, the Company had no outstanding warrants. NOTE 9 - LEASE The Company has a commercial lease for real estate. Rent expense for years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 was $15,271 and $15,470, respectively. The terms of the lease range from November 1, 2015 through October 31, 2016. Future minimum lease payments under this agreement as of February 29, 2016 are as follows: NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the Company's estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: As of February 29, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10,921,279 available to offset future taxable income. The Company evaluates its valuation allowance requirements based on projected future operations. When circumstances change and this causes a change in management’s judgment about the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is reflected in current income. As management of the Company does not currently believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will receive the benefit of this asset, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been established at both February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and foreign jurisdictions. All our tax returns are subject to tax examinations by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, or examinations by foreign tax authorities until respective statute of limitation. The Company currently has no tax years under examination. Based on the management’s assessment of pronouncements, they concluded that no significant impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position, and required no adjustment to the opening balance sheet accounts. The year-end analysis supports the same conclusion, and the Company does not have an accrual for uncertain tax positions as of February 29, 2016. As a result, tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances would not be meaningful. If interest and penalties were to be assessed, we would charge interest to interest expense, and penalties to other operating expense. It is not anticipated that unrecognized tax benefits would significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date. The Company is in arrears on filing its statutory income tax returns and is therefore has estimated the expected amount of loss carry forwards available once the outstanding returns are filed. The Company expects to have significant net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. NOTE 11 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company incurred the following items with directors and companies with common directors and shareholders: As of February 29, 2016, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses are $33,495 (February 28, 2015: $33,495) owing to an accounting firm in which a director of the Company is a partner and $2,389 (February 28, 2015: $2,389) to a shareholder with respect to unpaid fees and interest on promissory notes, $480,000 (February 28, 2015: $480,000) owing to shareholders of the Company in respect of royalties payable with no interest accruing, and $53,694 (February 28, 2015: $53,694) owing to the former president of the Company in respect of unpaid wages. As of February 29, 2016, included in advances payable is $60,158 (February 28, 2015: $76,100) owed to a company controlled by a director. As of February 29, 2016, promissory notes payable of $439,590 (February 28, 2015: $439,590) are due to a profit-sharing and retirement plan administered by a director of the Company. Terms are: All bear interest at 12% per annum. As of February 29, 2016, promissory note payable of $62,719 (February 28, 2015: $86,259) is personally guaranteed by a related party of the director of the company. NOTE 12 - CONCENTRATIONS AND CONTINGENCIES Concentrations Approximately 95% of the Company’s revenues are obtained from two (2) customers. The Company is exposed to significant sales and accounts receivable concentration. Sales to these customers are not made pursuant to a long term agreement. Customers are under no obligation to continue to purchase from the Company. For the year ended February 29, 2016, two (2) customers accounted for approximately 95% of revenue. For the year ended February 28, 2015 these two (2) customers accounted for 92% of revenue. For the year ended February 29, 2016, one (1) customer accounted for approximately 100% on accounts receivable. For the year ended February 28, 2015, there was no accounts receivable. Contingencies During the normal course of business we may from time to time be involved in litigation or other possible loss contingencies. As of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 management is not aware of any possible contingencies that would warrant disclosure pursuant to SFAS 5. Commitments Our future minimum royalty payments on the ScopeOut® agreement consist of the following: A 5% royalty with a $.75 per unit maximum “minimum royalty” to retain exclusivity with the following volumes: End of calendar year containing the second anniversary: 30,000 units End of calendar year containing the third anniversary: 60,000 units NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management has evaluated subsequent events through date which the financial statements were issued. Subsequent to February 29, 2016, the company issued 730,943 shares of common stock for subscriptions at $.30 per share. On April 21, 2016, the Company completed a 10-for-one reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock from approximately 144,186,784 common shares to 14,418,621 common shares. No fractional shares were issued. All fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were rounded down to the nearest whole number of common shares. On May 24, 2016, the Company entered into a nonbinding letter of intent with R and D USA, LLC for the acquisition of business assets comprising R and D, USA, LLC's means of production of soy meal and soy oil products and non-GMO products, certified organic products, refined oils, agricultural oils, and other related specialty fertilizer crop products, including all intellectual and intangible property related thereto. The Company intends to structure the transaction as a purchase of the Business Interests by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in consideration for which the Company shall initially raise $350,000 for the purpose of working capital for the soybean processing mill, and issue to R and D, USA, LLC common shares in the Company. The shares will be issued in two tiers of a number of common shares of the Company to be determined before entering a definitive agreement.\n",

MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Magna-Lab Inc. and Subsidiary Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Magna-Lab Inc. and Subsidiary (collectively, the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of February 28, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\\u2019 deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended February 28, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\u201cconsolidated financial statements\\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at February 28, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended February 28, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, will require additional capital to fund its current operating plan, and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\\u2019s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ RBSM LLP We have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 2016. New York, NY June 12, 2019 MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND GOING CONCERN: Company Activities - Magna-Lab Inc. and Subsidiary (collectively, the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) is focused on engaging in a \\u201creverse merger\\u201d transaction with an unrelated business that could benefit from the Company\\u2019s public reporting status. Additional activities have included preserving cash, attempting to raise capital to support its activities and continuing its public reporting. The Company was previously engaged in research, development and commercialization activities until it ceased such activities during the period September 2002 through March 2003 since the Company was unable to secure financing to support its planned activities. The Company\\u2019s efforts to enter into a strategic arrangement or to seek other means to realize value for its cardiac diagnostic technologies through sale, license or otherwise have been unsuccessful and therefore, in January 2017, the Company sold such technology to its President and CEO in exchange for relief from certain liabilities. Going Concern Consideration - As indicated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, at February 28, 2019, the Company had approximately $4,000 in cash and approximately $1,664,000 in negative working capital and stockholders\\u2019 deficit. For the year ended February 28, 2019, the Company had a net loss of approximately $148,000 and utilized approximately $32,000 in cash for operations. Further, losses are continuing subsequent to February 28, 2019. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company is in need of additional financing in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on March 1, 2019. The Company\\u2019s plans to deal with this uncertainty are described above in \\u201cCompany Activities.\\u201d Management\\u2019s plans to raise capital or merge with an unrelated business have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that management\\u2019s plans can be realized at all. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue operations as a going concern. No adjustment has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cUS GAAP\\u201d). All dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Magna-Lab Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cardiac MRI, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at February 28, 2019 and 2018. Income Taxes - The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of US GAAP in accounting for income taxes. The Company uses the asset and liability approach to financial reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts and are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company also complies with US GAAP in accounting for uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is \\u201cmore likely than not\\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Based on its analysis, the Company has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of February 28, 2019 and 2018. However, the Company's conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and other expenses, respectively. No interest expense or penalties have been recognized as of and for the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. Generally, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for years before 2015. Net Loss Per Share - The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of US GAAP in reporting its earnings per share. Net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of Class A Common and Class B Common shares outstanding. Basic (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. In the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, there were no options, warrants or derivative securities outstanding. Therefore, basic and diluted loss per share were the same for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under US GAAP, approximate the carrying amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets. Use of Estimates and Assumptions - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires the Company\\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can, and in many cases will, differ from those estimates. Stock-Based Compensation - The Company complies with the US GAAP accounting and reporting requirements for its Share-Based Payments. US GAAP requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Stock awards to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for based on an estimate of their fair value at the time of grant and, in the instance of options and warrants, are based upon a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with generally the following weighted-average assumptions: risk free rate of 5%; no dividend yield; option lives of five to nine years and expected volatility in excess of 200%. Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements - The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Subsequent Events - Management has evaluated subsequent events to determine if events or transactions occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, require potential adjustment to or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements and has concluded that all such events that would require recognition or disclosure have been recognized or disclosed. NOTE 3 - ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS: During the year ended Fevruary 28, 2018, accrued liabilities and accounts payable to various parties totaling approximately $74,000 were settled by our principal stockholder or its affiliates and such amounts are now payable to that principal stockholder (MALLC, see Note 4). The Company intends to make a proposal to various of its significant outstanding creditors to convert all amounts outstanding to them into common stock of the Company. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, accrued expenses includes approximately $18,000 payable to a third party, guaranteed by our principal shareholder, for amounts paid to an account payable in October 2007 on our behalf. This amount was repayable if the proposed merger transaction with this party was not completed. This party subsequently merged with another entity and abandoned its possible transaction with the Company, however there has not been a demand for repayment of this amount. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, accounts payable also includes approximately $14,000 related to certain pre-1997 accounts payable (Note 8). Some of the amounts recorded as accounts payable or accrued liabilities may have passed the statute of limitations for purposes of the counterparty seeking recovery of such monies. The Company has not undertaken a formal study to evaluate recorded payables past the statute of limitations for purposes of possible write-off of such payables. NOTE 4 - NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY: During the two years ended February 28, 2019, the Company has received an aggregate of approximately $89,000 of proceeds under notes payable to its majority shareholder, Magna Acquisition LLC (\\u201cMALLC\\u201d) and MALLC has paid approximately $74,000 of liabilities of the Company on our behalf, raising the principal amount outstanding under such notes to an aggregate of $687,250 and $653,750, respectively, (plus accrued interest of approximately $598,000 and $497,000, respectively) at February 28, 2019 and 2018. Such notes are unsecured and mature, by their terms, 120 days from issuance. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, approximately $679,650 and $566,000, respectively, face amount of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand. Such notes bear interest at 12% per year and such interest increases to 15% per year once the note is past its due date. Interest expense on such notes aggregated approximately $101,000 and $86,000 in the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Subsequent to February 28, 2019 on May 20, 2019 a director of the Company who is also the managing member of MALLC loaned an additional approximately $10,000 to the Company on the same terms as above except that the interest rate is 10% initially and increases to 12% upon default. The Company intends to make a proposal to MALLC and to the director who loaned money to the Company in May 2019 to convert all amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into common stock of the Company. NOTE 5 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT: Description of Class A and Class B Common Stock - The Class A and Class B common stock are identical in most respects except that: (i) the Class B common stock has five votes per share and the Class A common stock has one vote per share and, (ii) each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock and requires conversion to Class A for sale or transfer to a non-Class B stockholder and (iii) by understanding with an underwriter, no more Class B common stock can be issued. Holders of Class A and Class B common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends and, upon liquidation, are entitled to share ratably, as a single class, in the net assets available for distribution. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock are not redeemable, have no preemptive rights or cumulative voting power, and vote as one class, except in certain circumstances, in matters before the shareholders. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, 8,183 class B shares have been converted to Class A shares. Under an agreement with an underwriter, 10,000 shares of Class B common stock were forfeited by the holders based on performance measures that were not met. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2001, 2,698 of such forfeited shares were inadvertently released by the Company\\u2019s transfer agent; 1,376 of which have been returned. The Company has not been successful in recovering the remaining 1,322 shares. Principal Shareholder and Related Party Relationship - In a series of transactions consummated on October 31, 2005, MALLC acquired an aggregate of 607,727 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 56% of the Company\\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock at that time, and approximately 55% of the voting power represented by the Company\\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Stock at that time. Two directors of the Company and the Company\\u2019s Chief Financial Officer serve as sole managers of MALLC, with the ability to vote and dispose of such shares owned by MALLC by majority vote. See also Note 4. Stock Grant - In July 2008 the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $10,000 reflecting the fair value of 90,000 Class A common shares that were issuable to management at that time at the closing bid price of the Company\\u2019s stock. Because of cash constraints, the Company has not been able to issue such shares. However, for accounting purposes, the Company has accounted for such shares as though they have been issued. Stock Options and Warrants - There were no stock options or warrants issued or outstanding during the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. The Company\\u2019s Stock Option Plan has expired. NOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cTCJA\\u201d), which significantly modified U.S. corporate income tax law, was signed into law. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate income taxation, including but not limited to the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and generally eliminating net operating loss carrybacks, allowing net operating losses to carryforward without expiration, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including changes to the orphan drug tax credit and changes to the deductibility of research and experimental expenditures that will be effective in the future). The Company has not recorded any provisional adjustments in the financial statements in accordance with its current understanding of the TCJA and guidance currently available as of this filing. At February 28, 2019 and February 29, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively, to offset future income subject to tax. These resulted in an estimated $3.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of federal and $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of state deferred tax assets at February 28, 2019 and February 29, 2018. A full valuation allowance has been established for these deferred tax assets since their realization is considered unlikely. The difference between the tax provision at the federal corporation tax statuary rate and the rate (zero) included in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements occurs because the Company has never had any taxable income nor the ability to utilize loss carryforwards. Changes in the ownership of a majority of the fair market value of the Company's common stock would likely limit or eliminate the utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards and credits. Although a formal Section 382 study to determine whether a change in control has occurred has not been completed, the Company believes, based upon limited analysis, that such changes may have occurred in 1997, 2000 and 2005. Such carryforwards and credits expire between 2019 and 2035. It is likely that any \\u201creverse merger\\u201d or settlement of existing liabilities with equity or other strategic transaction is likely to result in a change in control under Section 382. NOTE 7 - OTHER MATTERS: Rent expense - Rent expense for each of the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $5,000 and $12,000 under a lease which expired in July 2019. NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Litigation - The Company knows of no pending litigation against it. Discontinued MAGNA-SL Business and Related 1997 Restructuring; Legacy payables - Commencing in February 1997, the Company executed a plan of restructuring to reposition itself out of its prior activity and into the cardiac activities conducted until 2003. Beginning in October 1997, reorganization counsel offered the Company\\u2019s creditors the opportunity to settle liabilities due them at substantially reduced amounts. Most of the Company\\u2019s liabilities from that time were settled in this manner as described more fully in the Company\\u2019s Form\\u2019s 10-KSB for prior years\\u2019. Through the passage of time, few of the remaining balances have been settled and others have been written-off. Residual amounts at February 28, 2019, are discussed in Note 3. The Company was also exposed to potential litigation from agreements entered into in connection with such pre-1997 business activities. However, the Company believes that the passage of time and statutes of limitation have mitigated such exposures and as such the Company has not recorded liabilities for such contingencies. Further, as mentioned in Note 1, in January 2018, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with its CEO in which the CEO purchased the residual technology and other assets and assumed all liabilities associated with that business.\",\n          \"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Cartesian, Inc. Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cartesian, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders\\u2019 equity for the 52-week periods ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\u201cfinancial statements\\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week periods ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has continued to use cash in operating activities and as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, has a note payable of approximately $3.3 million that may be called for redemption by the holder without specific cash resources to meet this obligation. These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\\u2019s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\\u201cPCAOB\\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. CARTESIAN, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS See notes to consolidated financial statements. CARTESIAN, INC.

CARTESIAN, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations - Cartesian, Inc. (\\u201cCartesian\\u201d or the \\u201cCompany\\u201d), formerly known as The Management Network Group, Inc., was founded in 1990 as a management consulting firm specializing in providing consulting services to the converging communications industry and the financial services firms that support it. A majority of the Company's revenues are from customers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Western Europe. Cartesian's corporate offices are located in Overland Park, Kansas. Liquidity and Going Concern - To date, the Company's cash resources and cash flows from financing activities have been sufficient to allow the Company to continue its operations. However, during fiscal year 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $4.5 million. At December 30, 2017, the Company had approximately $0.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and negative net working capital of $44,000. The Company's current capital resources may not be sufficient to repay a promissory note payable to Elutions Capital Ventures S.\\u00e0 r.l, a subsidiary of Elutions, in an aggregate original principal amount of $3.3 million (\\\"Elutions Note\\\"), if it were to be called for redemption, and to fund the Company's operations going forward. The Elutions Note matures on March 18, 2019, but may be called for redemption by the holder at any time and is payable 30 days after it is called for redemption. The Company is not in default under the Elutions Note and does not have any reason to currently expect that the Elutions Note will be called for redemption, given that the Company is paying its debts as they become due (including making timely payments of interest on the Elutions Note), and a call by the holder of the Elutions Note would cause Elutions to no longer have the right to purchase shares of stock pursuant to the Tracking Warrant if the Elutions Note is called for redemption. Under the Tracking Warrant, Elutions has the right to purchase up to 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share. The Tracking Warrant expires March 18, 2020. See Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., for additional discussion related to the Elutions Note. On March 21, 2018, Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \\\"Merger Agreement\\\") with Cartesian Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\\\"Parent\\\" or \\\"CHLLC\\\") and Cartesian Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\\\"Merger Sub\\\"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \\\"Merger\\\") Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent's designee made a working capital loan to the Company of $1,000,000. In connection with the loan transaction, the Company issued the Working Capital Note to Parent's designee, Auto Cash Financing, Inc. that bears interest at an annual rate of ten percent (10%). The Working Capital Note is secured by a lien on all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (except certain assets that are pledged by the Company to Elutions Capital Ventures S.a. r.l), subordinate only to certain existing and permitted encumbrances. The Working Capital Note is due and payable in full on the earlier of (a) the closing of the Merger, (b) the date the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (subject to an extension of the due date in certain circumstances), or (c) September 30, 2018. The Company has no reason to believe that the Merger will not occur or that the Merger Agreement may be terminated, but if the Merger Agreement is terminated the Company would not have the ability to repay the loan without the infusion of new debt or equity capital. Under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $400,000 to CHLLC in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, for more information regarding these transactions. If the Elutions Note is called for redemption by the holder or if the Company realizes significant negative cash flows from operations, it will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Elutions has certain rights of first offer in connection with debt financings by us, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, if we obtain debt financing from other lenders, subject to certain exceptions, Elutions may require us to redeem the Elutions Note and to repurchase the shares of our common stock originally acquired by Elutions at a price based upon market prices over 15 trading days prior to the repurchase. In addition, Elutions has certain preemptive rights in connection with equity issuances by the Company, subject to certain exceptions, and Cartesian and its subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of Elutions, issue options, warrants or similar rights or convertible securities, other than with respect to certain excluded issuances. The Company is exploring alternatives to address its liquidity needs in the event the Elutions Note is called for redemption. However, there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. The Company's ability to secure new financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions. If financing is obtained through the sale of additional equity securities or debt securities with equity features, it could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders. If adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, \\\"Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern\\\", that requires management to assess conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the financial statements are issued. Management has concluded under ASU 2014-15 that the current circumstances as discussed above raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to generate additional cash from operations or obtain financing in addition to the working capital loan, or if the Company is unable to arrange financing to pay off the Elutions Note upon a call for redemption or the Company becomes required to repay the Working Capital Note prior to the Merger, the Company may be unable to fund its operations in the future. Although, the Company currently expects that such financing can be obtained if necessary, subject to market conditions and the Company's financial condition at the time the Company seeks such financing, provided that, if it is in the form of debt financing, such financing would be at a very high interest rate, or if it is in the form of equity financing, such financing would be on terms that would be highly dilutive to stockholders. However, there can be no assurances that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these actions or that these actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet the Company's current obligations. If the Company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, it may have to (i) seek protection under bankruptcy reorganization laws, or (ii) liquidate its assets and the values it receives for its assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty, including any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cartesian and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year - The Company reports its operating results on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis. The fiscal year end is determined as the Saturday ending nearest December 31. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were each 52-week fiscal years and were comprised of four 13-week quarters. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are referred to herein as fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As described in further detail below, significant estimates include the estimates of costs to complete used to recognize revenues on fixed fee contracts, estimates for fair value of Elutions, Inc. (\\u201cElutions\\u201d) instruments, estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability and identifiable intangible assets, estimates used to determine the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and estimates used to determine the recoverability of deferred contract costs. Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue from time and materials consulting contracts in the period in which its services are performed. In addition to time and materials contracts, the Company also has fixed fee contracts. The Company recognizes revenues on milestone or deliverables-based fixed fee contracts and time and materials contracts not to exceed contract price using the percentage of completion-like method described by Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\\"FASB\\\") Accounting Standards Codification (\\\"ASC\\\") 605-35,\\\"Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\\\" For fixed fee contracts where services are not based on providing deliverables or achieving milestones, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the period during which such services are expected to be performed. In connection with some fixed fee contracts, the Company may receive payments from customers that exceed revenues up to that point in time. The Company records the excess of receipts from customers over recognized revenue as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability to the extent it is expected to be earned within twelve months from the date of the balance sheet. The FASB ASC 605-35 percentage-of-completion-like methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, the Company revises its cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known. Although there was no revenue recognized related to sales of software for fiscal years 2017 or 2016, the Company provides post-contract support (\\\"PCS\\\") services on historical software sales, including technical support and maintenance services as well as other professional services not essential to the functionality of the software. For those contracts that include PCS service arrangements which are not essential to the functionality of the software solution, the Company separates the FASB ASC 605-35 software services and PCS services utilizing the multiple-element arrangement model prescribed by FASB ASC 605-25, \\\"Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements \\\". The Company separated the PCS service elements and allocated total contract consideration to the contract elements based on the relative fair value of those elements utilizing PCS renewal terms as evidence of fair value. Revenues from PCS services are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the support and maintenance agreement. Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market investments and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value because of their relatively short-term maturities. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost or acquisition date fair value less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets and is computed using the straight-line method, and capital leases, if any, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Asset lives range from three to seven years for furniture and fixtures, software and computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the life of the lease or useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 360, \\\"Property, Plant and Equipment.\\u201d No impairments were identified in any period presented. Managed Services Implementation Revenues and Costs - Managed service arrangements provide for the delivery of a software or technology-based solution to clients over a period of time without the transfer of a license or a software sale to the customer. For long-term managed service agreements, implementation efforts are often necessary to develop the software utilized to deliver the managed service. Costs of such implementation efforts may include internal and external costs for coding or customizing systems and costs for conversion of client data. The Company may invoice its clients for implementation fees at the go-live date of the underlying solution. Lump sum implementation fees received from clients are initially deferred and recognized on a pro-rata basis as services are provided. Specific, incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are deferred pursuant to FASB ASC 605-35-25 and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized to the extent that the Company believes the recoverability of the costs from the contract is probable. If a client terminates a managed services arrangement prior to the end of the contract, a loss on the contract may be recorded, if applicable, and any remaining deferred implementation revenues and costs would then be recognized into earnings generally over the remaining service period through the termination date. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, deferred implementation costs related to managed service contracts were $536,000 and $432,000, respectively. Unamortized deferred implementation costs were $482,000 and $318,000 as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, of which $176,000 and $266,000 were included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $306,000 and $51,000, respectively, were included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Research and Development and Software Development Costs - Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 985-20, \\\"Software - Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed\\\" and FASB ASC 350-40, \\u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software.\\u201d Capitalization of software development costs for products to be sold to third parties begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ceases when the product is available for general release. The Company capitalizes development costs incurred during the period between the establishment of technological feasibility and the release of the final product to customers if such costs are material. In addition, the Company capitalizes software development costs for internal use software that it does not intend to market to third parties but uses to deliver services. The establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management concerning certain external factors including, but not limited to, the date technological feasibility is reached, anticipated future gross revenue, estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, $374,000 and $467,000, respectively, of these costs were expensed as incurred. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, $287,000 and $436,000, respectively, of internal use software development costs were capitalized. Goodwill - The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, \\\"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\\\" Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of the first fiscal month of the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The Company determines impairment by comparing the net assets of each reporting unit to its respective fair value. In the event a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In this situation, the Company must determine the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the reporting unit's fair value to each asset and liability of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured by the difference between the goodwill carrying value and the implied fair value. Due to a significant decrease in the Company\\u2019s stock price during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting units did not exceed their carrying value and therefore step two of the test was required. Based on the results of the second step of the goodwill impairment test (i.e., applying the income approach and market approach described below, the Company determined, as of July 2, 2016, that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value, which resulted in goodwill impairment of $10.8 million, representing all of that goodwill. See Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional discussion related to goodwill. Fair value of the Company\\u2019s reporting units is determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. The Company also considers the market approach to valuing its reporting units utilizing revenue and EBITDA multiples. The Company compares the results of its overall enterprise valuation as determined by the combination of the two approaches to the Company\\u2019s market capitalization. Significant management judgments related to these approaches include: \\u2022 Anticipated future cash flows and terminal value for each reporting unit - The income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows, including an estimate of terminal value. The projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in revenues and estimates of expected changes in operating margins. The Company\\u2019s projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated. Because management frequently updates its projections, the Company would expect to identify on a timely basis any significant differences between actual results and recent estimates. \\u2022 Selection of an appropriate discount rate - The income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yields as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. The discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants, and for that reason, the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis. It is possible that the discount rate can fluctuate from period to period. \\u2022 Selection of an appropriate multiple - The market approach requires the selection of an appropriate multiple to apply to revenues or EBITDA based on comparable guideline companies or transaction multiples. It is often difficult to identify companies or transactions with a similar profile in regards to revenue, geographic operations, risk profile and other factors. Intangible Assets - Identifiable intangible assets, resulting from the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities, consist of customer relationships, agreements not to compete, and a trade name. The Company amortizes the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated economic benefit period, from six months to four and one-half years. In accordance with FASB ASC 360, \\u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment,\\u201d the Company uses its best estimates based upon reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections to review for impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable. If the Company was to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset's remaining useful life, then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Additionally, information resulting from other events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable which would result in recognition of an impairment charge. No impairments were identified in any period presented. Income Taxes - The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company records the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits. The Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The measurement of any unrecognized tax benefit is based on management\\u2019s best judgment. The Company reviews these estimates and makes changes to recorded amounts of uncertain tax positions as facts and circumstances warrant. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation - Cartesian Ltd., the international operations of Cambridge Strategic Management Group, Inc., Farncombe France SARL, Farncombe Technology Limited, and Farncombe Engineering Services Limited conduct business primarily denominated in their respective local currency, which is their functional currency. Assets and liabilities have been translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses have been translated at exchange rates which approximate the average of the rates prevailing during each period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments totaled $6.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and is included in Total Stockholders\\u2019 Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of a subsidiary are re-measured at rates of exchange on the balance sheet date. Resulting gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in the Company\\u2019s results of operations. Realized and unrealized exchange losses included in the results of operations during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $332,000 and $535,000, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements requires bifurcation of certain embedded derivative instruments in certain debt or equity instruments, and measurement at their fair value for accounting purposes. A holder redemption feature embedded in the Company\\u2019s note payable requires bifurcation from its host instrument and is accounted for as a freestanding derivative. See Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc. and Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for discussion of this embedded derivative. Share-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for share-based payment awards using the provisions of FASB ASC 718, \\\"Compensation-Stock Compensation\\\". The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of service-based stock option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and compensation expense related to stock option grants is recognized on a graded vesting schedule over the vesting period. For stock options containing a market condition, the market conditions are required to be considered when calculating the grant date fair value. FASB ASC 718 requires selection of a valuation technique that best fits the circumstances of an award. In order to reflect the substantive characteristics of the market condition option award, a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model was used to calculate the grant date fair value of such stock options. Expense for the market condition stock options is recognized over the derived service period as determined through the Monte Carlo simulation model. For non-vested, performance-based stock awards, compensation expense is recognized based on management\\u2019s expectations with regard to achievement of certain performance and service conditions. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. Expense for the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straight-line basis over the implied service period of the award. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the restricted stock award agreement will be achieved, previously recognized compensation expense would be reversed in the period such a determination is made. For non-vested, service-based stock awards, compensation is recognized based on achievement of service conditions alone. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. Expense for the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a graded vesting schedule over the vesting period. See Note 5, Share-Based Compensation. Loss Per Share - The Company calculates and presents earnings (loss) per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding excludes treasury shares held by the Company. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed in the same manner except that the weighted average number of shares is increased for dilutive securities. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 260, \\\"Earnings per Share,\\\" the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating the dilutive effect of employee stock options, non-vested shares and warrants. The employee stock options, non-vested shares and warrants will have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when average market value of the underlying Company common stock during the respective period exceeds the assumed proceeds. For share-based payment awards with a performance condition, the Company must first use the guidance on contingently issuable shares in FASB ASC 260-10 to determine whether the awards should be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the reporting period. For all non-vested performance-based awards, the Company determines the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable at the end of the reporting period if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. In applying the treasury stock method, assumed proceeds include the amount, if any, the employee must pay upon exercise, the amount of compensation cost for future services that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the options and the vesting of non-vested shares. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, approximately 78,000 and 43,000 shares, respectively, related to outstanding stock options, non-vested shares and warrants that otherwise would have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation were not included because they would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss for those periods. Accounts Receivable - The Company has entered into agreements with third-party financial institutions under which it can selectively elect to transfer to the financial institutions accounts receivable with certain of the Company\\u2019s largest, international customers on a non-recourse basis. These agreements give the Company optionality to convert outstanding accounts receivable to cash. For transfers of accounts receivable under these agreements that qualify as sales, the Company applies the guidance in ASC 860, \\u201cTransfers and Servicing - Sales of Financial Assets\\u201d, which requires the derecognition of the carrying value of those accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognition of a loss on the sale of an asset in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $11.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively, of accounts receivable transferred pursuant to these agreements qualified as sales of receivables and the carrying amounts were derecognized. The loss on the sale of these accounts receivable recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss was approximately $47,000 and $75,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, the Company entered into a Factoring Agreement (\\\"Factoring Agreement\\\") with RTS Financial Service, Inc. (\\\"RTS\\\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Factoring Agreement, the Company may offer for sale, and RTS may purchase, certain accounts receivable of the Company on an account by account basis (such purchased accounts, the \\\"Purchased Accounts\\\"). Under the Factoring Agreement, upon purchase RTS becomes the absolute owner of the Purchased Accounts, which are payable directly to RTS, subject to certain repurchase obligations of the Company. Proceeds from transfers under the Factoring Agreement reflect the face value of the account receivable less a factor\\u2019s fee. The factor\\u2019s fee is computed on a daily basis until the amount of the Purchased Account is paid to RTS, and equals the amount of the Purchased Account multiplied by the sum of the prime rate then in effect plus 6.49% divided by 360. Upon purchase of a Purchased Account, RTS will pay to the Company the amount of the Purchased Account, less a reserve of 20% of that amount, which reserve (less the total fee calculated) is payable to the Company upon collection of the Purchased Account by RTS. The fee is recorded as interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the period the fee becomes payable. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company factored $7,400,000 and $3,000,000, respectively, of accounts receivable under the Factoring Agreement and recognized a liability of $1,917,000 and $768,000, respectively, which is recorded as Secured borrowing in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Until received, the reserve amount withheld at the time of transfer is recorded as a receivable and is included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amount recorded as a receivable for the reserve withheld by RTS was $381,000 and $154,000. The amount of fees recorded as interest expense were $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 and were immaterial for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Also in 2016, Cartesian Limited, a U.K. subsidiary of Cartesian, Inc., entered into an Invoice Discounting Agreement, a Debenture (security agreement) and certain related agreements (collectively, the \\\"Agreement\\\") with RBS Invoice Finance Limited (\\\"RBS\\\"). In April 2017, the Company entered into agreements with RBS to include Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd. and Farncombe Technology Limited as companies that could assign eligible accounts receivable to RBS. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Cartesian Limited, Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd., and Farncombe Technology Limited may assign to RBS certain eligible accounts receivable (such purchased accounts, the \\\"U.K. Purchased Accounts\\\"). The Agreement has a maximum funding level of \\u00a33,000,000 with respect to Cartesian Limited, a combined \\u00a31,000,000 maximum funding level with respect to Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd. and Farncombe Technology Limited, and a combined \\u00a33,000,000 maximum funding level with respect to the three entities. At the time of the purchase of a U.K. Purchased Account, RBS will make an initial payment to the applicable entity of no more than 50% of the U.K. Purchased Account. Upon collection of a U.K. Purchased Account, RBS will pay to the applicable entity the amount of the U.K. Purchased Account, less the initial payment and a discounting charge. The discounting charge is computed on a daily basis until the amount of the U.K. Purchased Account is paid to RBS, and equals the amount of the U.K. Purchased Account multiplied by the sum of the National Westminster Bank Plc base rate then in effect plus 1.75% divided by 365. The Agreement for Cartesian Limited includes a fixed fee service charge of \\u00a3833 per month and the agreement for Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd. includes a fixed fee service charge of \\u00a3250 per month. The agreements have loan concentration limits regarding the obligors on U.K. Purchased Accounts. The discounting charges are recorded as interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the period the fee becomes payable. The entities' obligations under the agreements are secured by certain assets of the entities, including all equipment and intellectual property of the entities, all stock of subsidiaries held by them and certain accounts receivable. Each of the three entities guarantees the obligations of the other entities. Under the Agreement, Cartesian Limited's net worth, as measured by issued share capital and retained earnings, less all intangible assets, may not fall below \\u00a37,500,000 in any 12 month period. RBS may require the applicable entity to repurchase U.K. Purchased Accounts upon a number of specified events, including if the entity breaches or defaults on any of its obligations under the Agreement or if in the case of Cartesian Limited it fails to meet the net worth requirement. The entities are in compliance with those obligations and Cartesian Limited meets the net worth requirement. The agreements have an initial term of 12 months and continue after the initial term until terminated by either the applicable entity or RBS. Each entity may terminate its agreement at any time during the initial term upon approval of RBS or upon six months' notice of intent to terminate (three months' notice in the case of the Farncombe entities). RBS may terminate the agreements upon certain other events or conditions included in the agreements. During fiscal year 2017, the entities factored $26.3 million under the agreements and as of December 30, 2017 recognized a liability of $2.5 million which is recorded as Secured borrowing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No amounts were factored under the agreements during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Inventory - In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 330, \\u201cInventory,\\u201d the Company\\u2019s inventory is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $0.2 million and $0.4 million in inventory, respectively, all of which was finished goods. All of the inventory was purchased in July 2014 from Elutions, Inc. (\\u201cElutions\\u201d), which owns more than five percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The net realizable value of the inventory was determined using the indirect cost approach. As a result of the evaluation of lower of cost or market, the Company recorded impairments of its inventory value of $0.2 million and $0.3 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company recorded an inventory adjustment of $0.3 million in Cost of Services related to a provision in the general framework agreement between the Company and Elutions (see Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc.), that states if the Company had not sold 75% of such inventory acquired from Elutions within one year after acquisition, Elutions is required upon request of the Company to source its requirements for future projects in the U.S. or U.K. from such inventory subject to a 10% discount against the Company\\u2019s purchase price until the Company has exhausted such inventory. In fiscal 2015, the Company requested that Elutions source its requirements for future projects from the inventory that was acquired by the Company from Elutions in July 2014. Management continues to work with Elutions to utilize the inventory and changes in management\\u2019s expectations in future periods could further impact the net realizable value of the inventory. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\\\"ASU\\\") 2017-09, \\\"Scope of Modification Accounting\\\", which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements, provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. For all entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect the application of ASU 2017-09 will have a material impact on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, \\\"Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\\\", which will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and the ASU requires adoption on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the application of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, \\u201cImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\\u201d, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required on the balance sheet by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. A retrospective or prospective approach can be used for the cash flow statement and a prospective approach is required for the statement of operations. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in fiscal year 2017 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, \\u201cLeases\\u201d which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU 2016-2 will have on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value thereby simplifying the existing guidance which required entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under the current guidance, market is defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. The newly issued guidance eliminates the requirement to determine replacement cost and defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The standard update intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of this new standard by one year and to permit early adoption beginning as of the original effective date of the new standard. The provisions of FASB ASU 2014-9 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and are to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company established an implementation team to evaluate and implement the new standard related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The Company provides consulting services and currently recognizes revenue from time and materials consulting contracts in the period in which its services are performed. In addition to time and materials contracts, the Company also has fixed fee contracts. The Company recognizes revenues on milestone or deliverables-based fixed fee contracts and time and materials contracts not to exceed contract price using the percentage of completion-like method at point of sale or delivery. We are completing an analysis of revenue streams and expect to combine a majority of contracts into various portfolios under the practical expedient permitted by ASU 2014-9. We currently expect to finalize our accounting policy during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and implement any necessary changes to processes and controls prior to adoption of the new standard. The Company expects to use the modified retrospective adoption method. Upon adoption, the Company will present expanded disclosure in accordance with the requirements of the standard. Based upon its analysis to date, the Company does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate the impacts of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the preliminary assessments are subject to change. 2. ACQUISITION On July 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the \\u201cPurchase Agreement\\u201d) and completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Farncombe France SARL, an entity formed under the laws of France, and Farncombe Technology Limited, a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales (collectively, the \\u201cFarncombe Entities\\u201d). The Farncombe Entities operate primarily in the U.K. and Europe and are in the business of providing strategic consultancy, content security, testing and implementation services for broadcast and broadband internet digital television. Farncombe\\u2019s experience in these areas along with Cartesian\\u2019s strategic, operational and technical capabilities in serving global service providers strengthens the Company\\u2019s ability to support convergence and quad play offerings in this growing market. The total purchase price, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, was \\u00a34,360,620 pounds sterling (approximately US$6.8 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) comprised of: \\u2022 Cash paid at the closing in the amount of \\u00a3654,093 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) which was funded from our available cash on hand and represents 15% of the purchase price. \\u2022 \\u00a31,308,186 pounds sterling (approximately US$2.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) settled by the issuance of 588,567 shares of Company common stock at the closing which equals 30% of the purchase price. The number of shares issued at the closing was calculated using a volume-weighted average share price for Company common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of the signing of the Purchase Agreement and based upon the average pounds sterling to dollar exchange rate recorded by the Financial Times for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement. The share price resulting from this calculation was \\u00a32.22 pounds sterling per share (US$3.46 per share). \\u2022 Additional consideration in the amount of \\u00a3654,093 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) which represents 15% of the purchase price, payable after the closing in accordance with the Purchase Agreement upon determination of the net working capital of the Farncombe Entities as prescribed in the Purchase Agreement, and as adjusted based upon the relative amounts of the net working capital of the Farncombe Entities as of May 31, 2015 and the closing and as compared to the target amount of net working capital as provided in the Purchase Agreement. \\u2022 Earn-out consideration (the \\u201cEarn-Out\\u201d) which was payable in cash and/or shares of Company common stock as elected by each Seller in the Purchase Agreement and represents 40% of the purchase price as described below. On April 17, 2017, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the \\u201cLetter Agreement\\u201d) with the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities (the \\u201cSellers\\u201d). In the Letter Agreement, the parties agreed to a final determination of the Earn-Out and the consideration payable related to net working capital as adjusted, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay to Sellers an additional amount equal to any amount received by the Company following the date of the Letter Agreement in respect of repayment of a loan of \\u20ac50,000 (approximately US$59,000 based on an exchange rate of \\u20ac1.000 = US$1.191 as of September 30, 2017) made to a third party by Farncombe Technology Limited prior to the closing under the Purchase Agreement. The parties also agreed that the Earn-Out target was expected to be achieved, and that the Company would pay 100% of the Earn-Out consideration described above to the Sellers. The Company also agreed in separate agreements that performance-based awards granted to two of the Sellers as employees of the Company based upon achievement of the Earn-Out would be paid in full. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to the Earn-Out consists of cash in an amount up to \\u00a3719,483 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000= US$1.320 as of July 31, 2017) and up to 461,055 shares of Company common stock (approximately \\u00a31,024,765 pounds sterling or US$1.3 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000= US$1.320 as of July 31, 2017) and based upon the value of the shares as described below. Amounts payable under the Earn-Out are based upon the amounts of specified revenues attributable to the Farncombe Entities after June 1, 2015 through July 22, 2017, as defined in the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of Company common stock payable under the Purchase Agreement at the closing and pursuant to the Earn-Out was determined based on the volume weighted average share price for Company common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement and based upon the average pounds sterling to dollar exchange rate recorded by the Financial Times for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement. The earn-out consideration was paid in full during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2015 the Company paid approximately $2.1 million to the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities with respect to the consideration payable related to net working capital as adjusted pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. This represented payment of a portion of the purchase price in the amount of \\u00a3654,093 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million) payable in accordance with the Purchase Agreement along with an additional \\u00a3743,753 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.1 million) related to the working capital adjustment for excess working capital under the Purchase Agreement. In March 2016, the Company paid additional amounts of approximately \\u00a3184,000 and \\u20ac12,000 (approximately US$0.3 million) to the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities with respect to net working capital as adjusted. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017, payments of \\u00a320,000 (approximately US$25,000) and \\u00a348,000 (approximately US$59,000), respectively, were paid to the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities with respect to net working capital as adjusted. Up until the effective date of the Letter Agreement, the Company had classified the Earn-Out liability as a Level 3 liability and the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was evaluated each reporting period with changes in its fair value included in the Company\\u2019s results of operations. During fiscal 2017, the change in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was an increase of $365,000 and during fiscal year 2016, the change in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was a decrease of $273,000. The changes in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. The balance of the Earn-Out liability as of December 31, 2016 was $1,903,000, which is recorded as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for discussion of the determination of fair value of the Earn-Out liability. 3. RELATED PARTY - STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AND INVESTMENT BY ELUTIONS, INC. Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc. On February 25, 2014, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the \\u201cInvestment Agreement\\u201d) with Elutions, a provider of operational business intelligence solutions. Under the Investment Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell shares of common stock to Elutions and to issue stock purchase warrants to Elutions, and the parties agreed that a subsidiary of Elutions would loan funds to a subsidiary of the Company. On March 18, 2014, the Company and Elutions completed the closing (the \\\"Closing\\\") of the transactions contemplated under the Investment Agreement. At the Closing, (a) the Company issued and sold 609,756 shares of common stock to Elutions at a price of $3.28 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000, (b) the Company's subsidiary, Cartesian Limited, issued the Elutions Note, a promissory note payable to Elutions Capital Ventures S.\\u00e0 r.l, a subsidiary of Elutions, in an aggregate original principal amount of $3,268,664, payable in equivalent Great Britain Pounds Sterling, and the Company issued to Elutions a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (Tracking) related to the Elutions Note to purchase 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share (the \\\"Tracking Warrant\\\"), and (c) the Company issued to Elutions a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (Commercial Incentive) pursuant to which Elutions can earn the right to purchase up to 3,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company at prices ranging from $3.85 per share to $4.85 per share based on the Company's financial results related to certain customer contracts obtained jointly by the Company and Elutions (the \\\"Incentive Warrant\\\"). The Incentive Warrant and the Tracking Warrant are referred to collectively below as the \\\"Warrants\\\". The Investment Agreement contains a number of agreements and covenants, including (i) certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the Elutions Note applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) an agreement of the Company to assign to Elutions certain customer contracts obtained jointly with Elutions if a competitor acquires control of the Company, (iii) confidentiality restrictions applicable to both parties, (iv) a standstill agreement of Elutions, (v) an agreement of the parties to negotiate in good faith for the purchase by Elutions of additional shares of Common Stock equal to 6.5% of outstanding shares from the Company or in open market purchases if Elutions then owns or is vested with the right to acquire 38.5% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, subject to any applicable stockholder approval requirements, (vi) the grant of a right of first offer to Elutions to loan funds to the Company in the future if the Company intends to incur or assume indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, (vii) a grant of pre-emptive rights to Elutions with respect to future issuances and sales of equity securities by the Company, subject to certain exceptions, (viii) the right of Elutions to designate one member of the Board of Directors of the Company if it meets certain ownership thresholds, and (ix) restrictions on the issuance by the Company of options, warrants or similar rights or convertible securities, other than with respect to certain excluded issuances. Promissory Note The Elutions Note issued at Closing by the Company's subsidiary, Cartesian Limited, in the aggregate original principal amount of $3,268,664, bears interest at the rate of 7.825% per year, payable monthly, and matures on March 18, 2019. The Elutions Note must be redeemed by Cartesian Limited upon notification by the holder at any time (the \\u201cHolder Redemption Option\\u201d) and may be prepaid by Cartesian Limited at any time after September 18, 2016. The obligations of Cartesian Limited under the Elutions Note are guaranteed by the Company pursuant to a Guaranty entered into by the Company at Closing and are secured by certain assets relating to client contracts involving Elutions pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into by the Company and Elutions at Closing. Amounts outstanding under the Elutions Note may be applied to the exercise price of the Company's common stock under the Tracking Warrant. Upon occurrence of an event of default, the Elutions Note would bear interest at 9.825% per year and could be declared immediately due and payable. Interest expense for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was approximately $254,000 and $259,000, respectively. Tracking Warrant Under the Tracking Warrant, Elutions may acquire 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share at any time and from time to time through March 18, 2020. The Company may require Elutions to exercise or forfeit the Tracking Warrant at any time (i) after 18 months if the trading price of the Company's common stock exceeds $5.50 per share for a specified period of time and the Company meets certain cash and working capital thresholds and (ii) after 30 months if the Company meets certain cash and working capital thresholds. To the extent amounts are outstanding under the Elutions Note, Elutions and the Company (if the Company is requiring exercise of the Tracking Warrant by Elutions as described above) may offset such amounts against the exercise price for shares of common stock acquired under the Tracking Warrant. The Tracking Warrant expires if the Elutions Note is redeemed upon exercise of the Holder Redemption Option. Incentive Warrant Under the Incentive Warrant, Elutions can earn the right to purchase up to 3,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company at prices ranging from $3.85 per share to $4.85 per share based on the Company's financial results as described below. The Incentive Warrant expires on March 18, 2020. The right to exercise the Incentive Warrant to acquire shares is subject to satisfaction of certain performance conditions based on revenues or cash received by the Company under customer contracts acquired jointly with Elutions through a five-year period from March 18, 2014 until March 18, 2019. The Incentive Warrant may vest upon satisfaction of the performance conditions during the five-year period. The number of shares of common stock for which the Incentive Warrant may vest during each fiscal quarter in the five-year period under the vesting provisions shall equal, without duplication, four percent of revenues recognized for such fiscal quarter or four percent of cash recognized or received by the Company during such quarter, for which revenues will be recognized in the future. In addition, the right to acquire shares may vest at the end of the five-year period for contracts that have been signed and with respect to which revenues are expected to be earned or cash is expected to be received after the end of the five-year period. The exercise price increases $0.25 per year for shares earned in each year of the five-year period and is payable in cash, provided that Elutions has the right to utilize a cashless exercise procedure to acquire shares of common stock under the Incentive Warrant for a limited period of time each year after the right to acquire such shares vests. Any shares utilized to exercise such cashless exercise right will not reduce the maximum number of shares that may be earned and acquired under the Incentive Warrant. Additional Warrant Provisions Each of the Warrants has economic anti-dilution protection provisions which provide for adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock which may be acquired pursuant to the Warrants in the event of issuances of shares of common stock by the Company at a price less than the 30-day volume weighted average trading price at the time of issuance, subject to a number of exceptions. Each of the Warrants also permits Elutions (subject to certain exceptions) to purchase shares in future equity offerings made by the Company on a pro rata basis to all stockholders, with such participation right based upon the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the Warrant. Registration Rights At Closing, the Company and Elutions entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the \\\"Registration Rights Agreement\\\"), pursuant to which the Company has obligations to register for resale the shares of common stock issued under the Investment Agreement and the Warrants. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company granted certain piggyback registration rights to Elutions and agreed to file and maintain a resale shelf registration statement for the benefit of Elutions. The resale shelf registration was filed with the SEC on August 12, 2014 and was declared effective on August 26, 2014. Commercial Relationship The Investment Agreement and the agreements and instruments described above are part of a strategic relationship between the Company and Elutions. As part of the strategic relationship, the parties entered into certain commercial framework documents, including a Market Development Agreement and related Inventory Agreement, on February 25, 2014, and enter into client agreements and bilateral agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business outlining the terms of the parties' commercial relationship with respect to business development and providing products, solutions and services to clients. The parties have agreed to a term of five years, with automatic two-year renewals unless notice is given, and subject to termination rights in certain events. The Company has agreed to restrictions during the term and for two years thereafter in regard to solutions or services that are substantially similar to or competitive with certain solutions or services of Elutions, and each party has agreed not to hire the other party's employees during the same period. The parties have agreed on a general framework for pursuing, entering into and implementing customer contracts, which includes providing for joint and separate client pursuits and marketing on an initial and ongoing basis, procedures for contracting with clients, procedures for interface between the parties, limited exclusivity requirements of Elutions relating to identified prospects and clients of the Company, intellectual property rights of Elutions to its products and related restrictions, restrictions regarding use of confidential information, limitations on liability of the parties, independent contractor status of the parties, limitations on publicity by the parties, and dispute resolution, including arbitration. The parties intend that specific pricing and allocation provisions and other specific commercial terms will be included in individual client statements of work, subject to mutually agreed gross margin requirements for the benefit of the Company. The parties also agreed to a framework for certain initial inventory orders and reorders by the Company from Elutions, and related commitments, timing and pricing procedures, when the Company is the prime contracting party under certain client statements of work. With respect to the required initial inventory order, the Company was required to purchase $3.0 million of inventory from Elutions upon receiving a booked order for Smart Building Services of a certain size from a customer. As a result of a customer agreement entered into by the Company, during fiscal 2014, the Company acquired $3.0 million in inventory from Elutions to fulfill its initial inventory commitment. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has not sold or licensed any of the initial inventory acquired from Elutions and has not acquired any additional inventory from Elutions. Under the Market Development Agreement, if the Company had not sold 75% of such inventory acquired from Elutions within one year after acquisition, Elutions is required upon request of the Company to source its requirements for future projects in the U.S. or U.K. from such inventory subject to a 10% discount against the Company\\u2019s purchase price until the Company has exhausted such inventory. In fiscal 2015, the Company requested that Elutions source its requirements for future projects from the inventory that was acquired by the Company from Elutions in July 2014. Management continues to work with Elutions to utilize the inventory and changes in management\\u2019s expectations in future periods could impact the net realizable value of the inventory. See Note 1, Organization and summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of the inventory recorded with respect to our agreements with Elutions. Also under the Market Development Agreement, Elutions agreed to dedicate three full-time equivalent employees for the purpose of various functions related to the furtherance of the strategic alliance, and the Company agreed to fund the cost of the three full-time equivalent employees at a rate of $36,750 per month. Pursuant to the Market Development Agreement, the Company terminated the provision of the three full-time equivalent employees effective in March 2016. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, expense related to these dedicated employees was $98,500. In connection with the customer agreement entered into by the Company in 2014, the Company entered into a subcontract with Elutions. Under the subcontract, Elutions agreed to provide all services in accordance with the customer agreement except for project management services, to be provided by the Company. In January 2017, the Company entered into an amendment of the customer agreement and an amendment to the subcontract with Elutions. The amendments increase the number of customer sites deployed and extend the term of the original agreement. The Company currently estimates total additional license payments to Elutions under the amendment to the subcontract are approximately $0.4 million and that the total remaining license payments to Elutions under the original subcontract, as amended, are approximately $0.7 million over the term of the subcontract, with additional amounts potentially payable to Elutions based upon energy savings achieved by the customer. Such amounts are recorded as managed services implementation costs which are included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Elutions also agreed in the subcontract to provide all equipment required under the customer agreement, and the Company agreed to advance to Elutions $400,000 of the equipment deployment cost. The advance amount was paid to Elutions during fiscal 2014. Elutions is required to repay the advanced amount plus interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum. The funds are netted directly from the customer\\u2019s annual payments. During each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company paid $291,000 to Elutions related to annual payments under the subcontract, as amended. Each of these payments was net of $112,000 related to the advanced amount in each fiscal year 2017 and 2016. As of December 30, 2017, the balance remaining for the advance to Elutions was $100,000 which is included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, the balance remaining for the advance to Elutions was $200,000 of which $100,000 is included in Other current assets and $100,000 is included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting Treatment The Holder Redemption Option was determined to be an embedded derivative liability that was required to be bifurcated and recorded as a liability. In addition, the Company determined that the provision of the Elutions Note that permits Cartesian Limited to prepay the Elutions Note after 18 months if the trading price of the Company\\u2019s common stock exceeds $5.50 per share for a specified period of time and to prepay the Elutions Note after 30 months are each an embedded derivative asset that requires bifurcation (the \\u201cIssuer Call Option\\u201d). As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Issuer Call Option was determined to be immaterial. The carrying value of the Elutions Note as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $3,269,000 and as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 the fair value of the Elutions Note was $2,636,000 and $2,703,000, respectively. The Incentive Warrant and Tracking Warrant are accounted for as equity instruments. See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements for discussion of the determination of fair values. The vesting of the Incentive Warrant is contingent on services to be provided by Elutions and the achievement of performance conditions by Elutions. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, Elutions earned 20,911 and 27,194 vested shares under the Incentive Warrant and the Company recognized $57,000 and $53,000 of expense related to these vested shares, respectively. 4. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performed its impairment testing for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC 350, \\u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other.\\u201d The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit\\u2019s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit\\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value, the Company would be required to progress to the second step. In the second step, the Company calculates the implied fair value of goodwill and compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill on the Company\\u2019s balance sheet. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be required to be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of the first fiscal month of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. Due to a significant decrease in the Company\\u2019s stock price during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting units did not exceed their carrying value and therefore step two of the test was required. Based on the results of the second step of the goodwill impairment test (i.e., applying the income approach and market approach described under Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Goodwill), the Company determined, as of July 2, 2016, that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value, which resulted in goodwill impairment of $10.8 million, representing all of that goodwill. The facts and circumstances that led to the impairment of goodwill were primarily a result of the decreased market value of the Company based upon the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table summarizes the changes in the major classes of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 (in thousands). The identifiable intangible assets in the table above resulted from the July 2015 acquisition of the Farncombe Entities and their balances include the effects of foreign currency translation. This acquisition is discussed further in Note 2, Acquisition. Tradename, non-compete agreements and customer relationships carry amortization periods of six months, four and one-half years and three and one-half years, respectively. The amortization periods are based on the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets. Aggregate amortization expense related to intangible assets was $275,000 and $301,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to amortizing intangible assets as of December 30, 2017. 5. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options and stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Groups of employees or non-employee directors that have similar historical and expected exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted include risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected volatility factor, and expected dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the time of grant for a term equal to the expected life of the stock option; the expected life is determined using the simplified method of estimating the life as allowed under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110; and the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock price for a period of time equal to the expected life of the stock option. With the exception of the service-based non-vested share awards and the performance-based non-vested share awards discussed below, nearly all of the Company's share-based compensation arrangements utilize graded vesting schedules where a portion of the grant vests annually over a period of two to four years. The Company has a policy of recognizing compensation expense for awards with graded vesting over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. This policy has the effect of accelerating the recognition of expense when compared to a straight-line amortization methodology. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has two share-based compensation plans under which awards are outstanding, which are described below. No income tax benefits were recognized in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 due to the full valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets. In addition, no compensation costs related to these arrangements were capitalized in either year. The Company has historically issued and expects to continue to issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises, vesting of non-vested shares or purchases of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN The Company's Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, (the \\\"Equity Plan\\\"), is a stockholder approved plan, which provides for the granting of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to employees, and nonqualified stock options, nonvested stock, and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. The Equity Plan is scheduled to expire in June 2025. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has 1,295,585 shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options or for future awards under the Equity Plan. Stock Options Service-Based Stock Option Awards - Stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors. As of December 30, 2017, all options granted under the Equity Plan were non-qualified stock options. Service-based options generally become exercisable over a one to four-year period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years. A summary of the service-based stock option activity of the Company's Equity Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: The Company did not grant any service-based stock option awards during fiscal year 2017. During fiscal 2016, the Company granted a service-based stock option award for 37,500 shares of the Company's common stock having an exercise price of $1.10 per share. The stock option vests solely based on employee service over a three-year period. The Company recorded share-based compensation expense in connection with service-based stock option awards of $18,000 and $16,000 during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 30, 2017, there was $8,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based stock option awards, and this unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 10 months. As of December 31, 2016, there was $26,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based stock option awards. Market Condition Stock Option Awards - A summary of the market condition stock option activity under the Equity Plan, as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: On September 28, 2016, the Company granted non-qualified stock option awards for 125,000 shares of the Company\\u2019s common stock having an exercise price of $1.25 per share. On June 16, 2015 the Company granted a non-qualified stock option award for 200,000 shares of the Company\\u2019s common stock having an exercise price of $3.34 per share. These stock options will vest only if the price of the Company\\u2019s common stock reaches certain price targets, as follows: \\u2022 the stock option will vest with respect to 116,666 shares if at any time the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on each day during a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $4.00 per share; \\u2022 the stock option will vest with respect to an additional 116,667 shares if at any time the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on each day during a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $5.00 per share; and \\u2022 the stock option will vest with respect to an additional 91,667 shares if at any time the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on each day during a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $6.00 per share. For stock options which contain market conditions, the market conditions are required to be considered when calculating the grant date fair value. FASB ASC 718 - \\u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation,\\u201d requires us to select a valuation technique that best fits the circumstances of an award. In order to reflect the substantive characteristics of the market condition option award, a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model was used to calculate the grant date fair value of such stock options. Monte Carlo approaches are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results. This approach allows the calculation of the value of such stock options based on a large number of possible stock price path scenarios. Expense for the market condition stock options is recognized over the derived service period as determined through the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value and derived service periods calculated for this market condition stock option award by vesting tranche for the market condition stock option awards granted in September 2016 were as follows: The fair value and derived service periods calculated for this market condition stock option award by vesting tranche for the market condition stock option awards granted in June 2015 were as follows: During fiscal years 2017 and 2016 the Company recorded $7,000 and $144,000 of share-based compensation expense in connection with this market condition stock option award. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there was $30,000 and $37,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to the market condition stock option awards, respectively, As of December 30, 2017, the unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 19 months. Non-vested Shares Service-Based Non-vested Share Awards - A summary of the status of service-based non-vested share awards issued under the Equity Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: On July 25, 2017, the Company granted 50,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest one year from the date of grant. Also on July 25, 2017, the Company granted 30,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest two years from the date of grant. On March 13, 2017, the Company granted 60,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest two years from the date of grant. On July 22, 2016, the Company granted 40,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest one year from the date of grant. These service-based non-vested share awards are valued at the date of grant based on the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock, and are expensed using the straight-line method over the requisite service period (which is the vesting period of the award). During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $71,000 and $13,000 of stock-based compensation expense in connection with these service-based non-vested share awards. As of December 30, 2017, there is an estimated $78,000 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to these service-based non-vested share awards, and this unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a period of 13 months. As of December 31, 2016, there was $16,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based non-vested share awards. On July 22, 2016 and October 3, 2016, the Company granted 59,922 and 72,500 shares, respectively, of service-based non-vested stock to non-employees for services provided under consulting agreements which had three-year terms. In accordance with ASC 718, the fair value measurement date for these non-vested stock awards is the performance completion date. The fair value of the awards granted to the non-employee consultants was remeasured each reporting period based on their fair value at that time up to the performance completion date. The changes in fair value each reporting period were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Effective March 31, 2017, the consulting agreements were terminated and in accordance with the consulting agreements, all unvested shares of non-vested stock granted under those agreements vested as of March 31, 2017. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $85,000 and $25,000 of stock-based compensation expense in connection with these service-based non-vested share awards. Performance-Based Non-vested Share Awards - A summary of the status of performance-based non-vested share awards issued under the Equity Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: On July 22, 2015, the Company granted 58,940 shares of non-vested stock to two employees that vested in full on July 1, 2017 in proportion to the earn-out consideration paid pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities described in Note 2, Acquisition. On April 8, 2013, the Company granted performance-based non-vested share awards for a total of 800,000 shares of Common Stock to various executive officers and employees of the Company that vest in proportion to the ratio that the Company's \\\"Cumulative Net Non-GAAP EBITDA\\\" achieved over a four-year performance period compares to the Cumulative Net Non-GAAP EBITDA goal of $14 million. All 800,000 non-vested shares had a grant date fair value of $3.14 per share. The first potential vesting date was the Company's earnings release date for its 2014 first fiscal quarter and each subsequent potential vesting date was each of the Company's quarterly earnings release dates thereafter through the release date for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Shares not vested as of the release date for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 were forfeited. Share-based compensation cost for performance-based non-vested share awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of shares expected to be earned at the end of the performance period, based on the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and is recognized as expense using the straight-line method over the performance period based upon the probable number of shares expected to vest. The Company estimates and excludes compensation cost related to awards not expected to vest based upon estimated forfeitures. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $144,000 of share-based compensation income and $88,000 of share-based compensation expense, respectively, in connection with performance-based non-vested share awards. As of December 30, 2017, there was no remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to performance-based non-vested share awards. As of December 31, 2016, there was an estimated $46,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to performance-based non-vested share awards. 2000 SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK PLAN The Supplemental Stock Plan expired May 23, 2010. The outstanding awards issued pursuant to the Supplemental Stock Plan will remain subject to the terms of the Supplemental Stock Plan following expiration of the plan. The Supplemental Stock Plan provided the Company's common stock for the granting of nonqualified stock options to employees and was not subject to stockholder approval. Vesting and exercise provisions were determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted under the plan generally become exercisable over a period of up to four years beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years. A summary of the option activity under the Company's Supplemental Stock Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: No awards have been granted under the Supplemental Stock Plan since it expired on May 23, 2010. There were no options exercised during fiscal year 2017 or fiscal year 2016. As of December 30, 2017 there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of stock options issued under the Supplemental Stock Plan. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\\\"ESPP\\\"), shares of the Company's common stock may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the enrollment period or on the last day of each six-month period over the subsequent two years. Employees may purchase shares through a payroll deduction program having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized net expense of $13,000 and $17,000, respectively, in accordance with FASB ASC 718 associated with the ESPP. 6. SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION Accrued payroll, bonuses and related expenses and Other accrued liabilities consist of the following (amounts in thousands): 7. BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Company identifies its segments based on the way management organizes the Company to assess performance and make operating decisions regarding the allocation of resources. In accordance with the criteria in FASB ASC 280 \\\"Segment Reporting,\\\" the Company has concluded it has three reportable segments: the North America segment, the EMEA segment and the Strategic Alliances segment. The North America and EMEA segments are both single reportable, operating segments that encompass the Company\\u2019s operational, technology and software consulting services inside of North America and outside of North America, respectively. Both reportable segments offer management consulting, custom developed software, and technical services. The Strategic Alliances reportable segment is a single, reportable segment that includes the Company\\u2019s world-wide commercial activities undertaken with third-party service or solutions providers. Management evaluates segment performance based upon income (loss) from operations, excluding share-based compensation (benefits) and depreciation. There were no inter-segment revenues during fiscal years 2017 and 2016. In addition, in its administrative division, entitled \\\"Not Allocated to Segments,\\\" the Company accounts for non-operating activity and the costs of providing corporate and other administrative services to all the segments, including, but not limited to, goodwill impairment, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, certain research and development costs, and costs related to the arbitration with the Company\\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional discussion of the arbitration costs. Summarized financial information concerning the Company's reportable segments is shown in the following table (amounts in thousands): Segment assets, regularly reviewed by management as part of its overall assessment of the segments' performance, include both billed and unbilled trade accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory, and certain other assets, if applicable. Assets not assigned to segments include cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current investments, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets and deferred tax assets, excluding deferred tax assets recognized on accounts receivable reserves, which are assigned to their segments. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 280-10, revenues earned in the United States and internationally based on the location where the services are performed are shown in the following table (amounts in thousands): In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 280-10, long-lived assets, excluding intangible assets, by geographic area are shown in the following table (amounts in thousands): Major customers in terms of significance to Cartesian's revenues (i.e. in excess of 10% of revenues) for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and accounts receivable as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows (amounts in thousands): Revenues from the Company's ten most significant customers accounted for approximately 82% and 77% of revenues in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Substantially all of Cartesian's receivables are obligations of companies in the communications, media and entertainment industries. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security on its accounts receivable. The credit risk on these accounts is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Company records bad debt expense based on judgment about the anticipated default rate on receivables owed to Cartesian at the end of the reporting period. That judgment is based on the Company's uncollected account experience in prior years and the ongoing evaluation of the credit status of Cartesian's customers and the communications industry in general. 8. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $1,250,000 and $994,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. 9. INCOME TAXES For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following (amounts in thousands): For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the income tax benefit (provision) consists of the following (amounts in thousands): During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded income tax benefits of $197,000 and $248,000, respectively. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2017 was primarily related to refinements of the projected 2016 U.K. tax liabilities. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2016 was primarily related to a $0.8 million domestic benefit recognized in connection with adjustments to domestic deferred taxes related to the impairment of goodwill amortized for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes netted with a $0.6 million international expense recognized in connection with the international valuation allowance in fiscal 2016. The Company has reserved all of its domestic and international net deferred tax assets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 with a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, \\u201cIncome Taxes,\\u201d which requires an estimation of the recoverability of the recorded income tax asset balances. Related to the going concern assertion in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company reserved all of its international net deferred tax assets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 with a valuation allowance. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had recorded $25.0 million and $36.6 million, respectively, of valuation allowances attributable to its domestic and international net deferred tax assets. The determination of recording and releasing valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is made, in part, pursuant to the Company\\u2019s assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable income against which benefits of the deferred tax assets may or may not be realized. Significant judgment is required in making estimates regarding the Company\\u2019s ability to generate income in future periods. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient income in future periods. In evaluating the ability to use its deferred tax assets, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence including the Company's past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent three fiscal years and the Company's forecast of future income. In determining future income, the Company is responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state, federal and international operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the underlying business. The following is a reconciliation between the benefit (provision) for income taxes and the amounts computed based on loss before income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate (amounts in thousands): The significant components of deferred income tax assets and the related balance sheet classifications, as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, are as follows (amounts in thousands): As of December 30, 2017, the Company has U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $89.7 million which begin expiring in 2020. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $50.7 million. These net operating losses expire at various times between 2018 and 2036. In addition, as of December 30, 2017, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $3.4 million all of which primarily have no expiration date. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has net foreign tax credits of $1.0 million. If unutilized, the expiration of these foreign tax credits is $317,000 and $689,000 in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. On December 22, 2017 the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changes the existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, as well as other changes. As a result of enactment of the legislation, the Company incurred a $13.1 million reduction to the gross deferred tax assets of the Company, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower corporate tax rates. There was not an impact to the tax provision related to the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Due to the going concern assertion and full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Company, the tax reform legislation has zero net effect on the Company\\u2019s deferred tax assets as a whole. There are no income tax effects of the tax reform legislation that for which the accounting is incomplete or that are reported as provisional amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company analyzes its uncertain tax positions pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC 740 \\\"Income Taxes\\\" that prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained based on its technical merit. If the tax position is deemed \\\"more-likely-than-not\\\" to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no recorded liability for uncertain tax positions. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2000. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has no income tax examinations in process. 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company utilizes the methods of fair value measurement as described in FASB ASC 820, \\u201cFair Value Measurements\\u201d to value its financial assets and liabilities, including the financial instruments issued in the transaction described in Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc. and the contingent consideration liability described in Note 2, Acquisition. As defined in FASB ASC 820, fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Recurring Fair Value Measurements The fair value of the Company\\u2019s Elutions Note and the Holder Redemption Option were determined using a binomial lattice model. (See Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., for further discussion of the Elutions Note and Holder Redemption Option.) The Holder Redemption Option was determined to be an embedded derivative liability that was required to be bifurcated and recorded as a liability. The Company has classified the Holder Redemption Option and Elutions Note as Level 3 liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the Holder Redemption Option are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company reassesses the fair value of this liability on a quarterly basis. Based on that assessment, the Company recognized a decrease of $337,000 and an increase of $18,000 in the fair value of this liability during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. To determine the fair value of the Holder Redemption Option, management evaluates assumptions that require significant judgment. Changes in certain inputs to the valuation model, including the Company\\u2019s period end stock price and stock volatility, can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value. The fair value recorded for the Holder Redemption Option may vary significantly from period to period. This variability may result in the actual liability for a period either above or below the estimates recorded in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements, resulting in significant fluctuations in other income (expense) as a result of the corresponding non-cash gain or loss recorded. The model requires the following inputs: (i) price of the Company\\u2019s common stock; (ii) the expected life of the instrument or derivative; (iii) risk-free interest rate; (iv) estimated dividend yield, and (v) estimated stock volatility. Assumptions used in the calculation require significant management judgment. The following table sets forth the Level 3 inputs to the binomial lattice model that were used to determine the fair value of the Elutions Note and the Holder Redemption Option: In addition, the Company determined that the provision of the Elutions Note that permits Cartesian Limited to prepay the Elutions Note after 18 months if the trading price of the Company\\u2019s common stock exceeds $5.50 per share for a specified period of time is an embedded derivative asset that requires bifurcation (the \\u201cIssuer Call Option\\u201d). As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Issuer Call Option was determined to be immaterial. Because the Company measures the Holder Redemption Option at fair value on a recurring basis, transfers, if any, between the levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 liabilities during fiscal years 2017 or 2016. In connection with the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities, the Company recorded a liability related to the Earn-Out portion of the purchase consideration. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had classified the Earn-Out liability as a Level 3 liability and the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was evaluated each reporting period and changes in its fair value were included in the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation using a risk-adjusted discount rate applied to management\\u2019s estimate of forecasted revenues that were eligible under the Earn-Out as described in the Purchase Agreement. To determine the fair value of the Earn-Out liability, management evaluated assumptions that require significant judgment. Changes in certain inputs to the valuation model, including the Company\\u2019s estimate of future revenues, can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value. On April 17, 2017, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities whereby the parties agreed to a final determination of the Earn-Out, that the Earn-Out target was expected to be achieved, and that the Company would pay 100% of the Earn-Out consideration described above to the Sellers. The Earn-Out was paid in full during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 2, Acquisition, for further discussion of the Earn-Out liability. Because the Company measured the Earn-Out liability at fair value on a recurring basis transfers, if any, between the levels of the fair value hierarchy were recognized at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 liabilities during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following (in thousands): The following table summarizes the changes to the fair value of the Holder Redemption Option which is a Level 3 liability (in thousands): Other Fair Value Disclosures The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the relatively short-term maturities of these financial instruments. 11. LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases office facilities, computer equipment and office furniture under various operating leases expiring at various dates through May 2022. Following is a summary of future minimum payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancellable lease terms at December 30, 2017 (amounts in thousands): Total rental expense, net of subtenant rents received, was approximately $1,922,000 and $1,872,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, $138,000 and $61,000 was recorded in cost of services, respectively, and $1,784,000 and $1,811,000 was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. The Company recorded $328,000 in rental income from subtenants during fiscal year 2017. There was no rental income from subtenants recognized in fiscal 2016. Rents received from subtenants were recorded as an offset to rental expense. In 2015, the Company took steps to discontinue use of its leased facilities in McLean, Virginia. The space is leased under an operating lease with a term expiring in July 2019 and is comprised of 4,823 square feet. Although the Company has clients in this geographic market, projects are performed from either client sites or other Company locations, and thus the space is not required or used by Company employees, and specifically not used for revenue-generating activities. In March 2017, the Company entered into a sublease for this facility. The sublease does not relieve the Company of its primary obligations under the original lease. We accounted for the discontinuation of use of this property in accordance with FASB ASC 420, \\u201cExit or Disposal Cost Obligations\\u201d and as such recorded a liability during fiscal 2015. As of December 30, 2017, a liability of $158,000 is recorded of which $128,000 is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and $30,000 is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, a liability of $185,000 is recorded of which $103,000 is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and $82,000 is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expense related to this liability is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The amounts recorded as of December 31, 2016, were calculated using probability-weighted cash flow analysis and represented the present value, calculated using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, of our remaining costs under the remaining term of the lease, net of estimated subleases we expected to obtain. 12. LETTERS OF CREDIT In connection with the leasing of office space, the Company provides security deposits in the form of two irrevocable letters of credit with financial institutions for the benefit of the respective landlords. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the required, total collateral amount was $103,000 and $103,000, respectively. The collateral deposited for these letters of credit is included in \\\"Other Noncurrent Assets\\\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. No obligation has been recorded in connection with the letters of credit on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is not subject to any material litigation, individually and in the aggregate, as of December 30, 2017. However, the Company may become involved in various legal and administrative actions arising in the normal course of business. These could include actions brought by taxing authorities challenging the employment status of consultants utilized by the Company. In addition, future customer bankruptcies could result in additional claims on collected balances for professional services near the bankruptcy filing date. When management has determined that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability had been incurred related to an action, claim or assessment and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company will record a liability for such estimated loss in the appropriate accounting period. The resolution of any of such actions, claims, or the matters described above may have an impact on the financial results for the period in which they occur. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company renewed an agreement under which it had a commitment to purchase a minimum of $412,000 in computer software over a three-year period. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company amended the agreement to include an additional commitment of $95,000 over a two-year period. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had an obligation of $181,000 remaining under this commitment. These amounts were paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 14. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On June 7, 2016, the Company\\u2019s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the Company\\u2019s previously announced stock repurchase program to extend the program through June 30, 2017. The program was initially authorized in February 2014 and was previously extended in June 2015. The program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $2 million of Company common stock. Under the program, repurchases may be made by the Company from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. The program expired on June 30, 2017. There were no share repurchases under the share repurchase program during fiscal years 2017 or 2016. 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company offers defined contribution plans to eligible employees. Such employees may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation in accordance with the plans\\u2019 guidelines. The plans provide for Company contributions that are subject to maximum limitations as defined by the plans. Company contributions to its defined contribution plans totaled $1.2 million and $1.4 million in the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Agreement and Plan of Merger On March 21, 2018, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \\\"Merger Agreement\\\") with Cartesian Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\\\"Parent\\\") and Cartesian Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\\\"Merger Sub\\\"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \\\"Merger\\\"). The proposed transaction is structured as a two-step transaction consisting of a first-step cash tender offer for outstanding shares of the Company's common stock followed by the second-step Merger. CHLLC and Merger Sub are affiliates of Blackstreet Capital Holdings. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will commence a cash tender offer (the \\\"Offer\\\") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.005 per share, of the Company (\\\"Company Common Stock\\\" or the \\\"Shares\\\") at a price per share equal to $0.40, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the \\\"Offer Price\\\"), subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. Upon satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement and applicable law) of specified conditions in the Merger Agreement (including receipt of any required affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares (the \\\"Company Required Vote\\\")), each Share remaining outstanding after consummation of the Offer (other than Shares owned directly by the Company or Merger Sub or Shares as to which appraisal rights have been perfected) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes. If 90% or more of the outstanding Shares are purchased in the Offer, the Merger may be effected by a resolution adopted by the Merger Sub's board of directors without the need for a meeting of the Company's stockholders. The obligations of Merger Sub to purchase Shares tendered in the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) a number of Shares must have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that, when added to the number of Shares (if any) then beneficially owned by Parent or its controlled affiliates (including Merger Sub), equals at least a majority of all Shares then outstanding (together with Shares underlying options as to which notice of exercise have been received prior to expiration of the Offer but not then issued); (ii) the absence of any order, applicable law or other legal restraints of an applicable governmental authority enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the proposed Merger; (iii) the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to specified materiality qualifications; (iv) compliance, in all material respects, by the Company with its covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; (v) the absence, since the date of execution of the Merger Agreement, of an event, change, effect, occurrence, circumstance or development, that individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and (vi) that the Merger Agreement has not been terminated. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this nature, including the obligation of the Company to (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to carry on its business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and (ii) comply with certain other negative operating covenants. The Merger Agreement also contains a customary \\\"no solicitation\\\" provision that, subject to certain exceptions, restricts the Company's ability to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or submission that could lead to a third-party takeover proposal or (ii) enter into, engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any nonpublic information relating to the Company to, or execute any agreement with, third parties in connection with a third-party takeover proposal. The no solicitation provision is subject to a \\\"fiduciary out\\\" that permits the Company, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations, to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) upon payment to Parent of the termination fee described below. In addition, prior to the Company Required Vote, the Company's Board of Directors (the \\\"Board\\\") may, among other things, change its recommendation that the Company's stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares in the Offer or otherwise approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger in connection with a Superior Proposal or to comply with its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company, subject to complying with the procedures in the Merger Agreement and payment of the termination fee described below. The Merger Agreement also contains certain customary termination rights for both Parent and the Company, including, among others, (i) the ability of either Parent or the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement if (A) a majority of the Shares have not been purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer within 20 business days after commencement of the Offer, or (B) the Merger is not consummated on or before July 31, 2018; (ii) the ability of the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations (including the right of Parent to make a more favorable offer within three days after receiving notice of the Superior Proposal), and to enter into an agreement for an alternative transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (iii) the ability of Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement due to a change in the recommendation of the Board or a breach of the \\\"no solicitation\\\" provisions by the Company, the failure of the Company to comply with its covenants in all material respects, or any inaccuracy of the Company's representations or warranties that would cause a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is required to pay Parent a termination fee of $400,000 upon termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, including if the Merger is prohibited or prevented by certain government actions, if Parent or the Company terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the Merger not being consummated by July 31, 2018, if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or if Parent terminates the Merger Agreement as described in clause (iii) above. Tender and Support Agreements As a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement, the Parent required that each of the Company's officers and directors enter into a Tender and Support Agreement in favor of Parent and Merger Sub. That agreement requires the Company's officers and directors to include, among other things, an irrevocable agreement to tender all of their Shares in the Offer. Rights Agreement On March 21, 2018, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2010, by and between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as amended, the \\\"Rights Agreement\\\") to provide that the rights issued under the Rights Agreement would be inapplicable to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Working Capital Loan Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent's designee made a working capital loan to the Company of $1,000,000. In connection with the loan transaction, the Company issued a Term Loan Note for Working Capital dated March 21, 2018 (\\\"Working Capital Note\\\") with Parent's designee, Auto Cash Financing, Inc. that bears interest at an annual rate of ten percent (10%). The Working Capital Note is secured by a lien on all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (except certain assets that are pledged by the Company to Elutions Capital Ventures S.a. r.l) pursuant to (i) a Security Agreement dated March 21, 2018 (\\\"Security Agreement\\\") among the Company, its U.S. subsidiaries, and Auto Cash Financing, Inc. and (ii) a Debenture dated March 21, 2018 among the Company' foreign subsidiaries and Auto Cash Financing, Inc. (the \\\"Debenture Agreement\\\"). The liens under the 2018 Security Agreement and the Debenture Agreement are subordinate only to Permitted Encumbrances as defined in the 2018 Security Agreement and any Permitted Security as defined in the Debenture Agreement. In connection with the preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements, an evaluation of subsequent events was performed through the date these audited consolidated financial statements were issued and, other than the events above, there are no other events that have occurred that would require adjustments or disclosure to the Company\\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements.\",\n          \"ANTILIA GROUP, CORP.

Notes to the Audited Financial Statements January 31, 2019 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS ANTILIA GROUP, CORP. (\\u201cthe Company\\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on September 19, 2016. We are a development stage company that plans to engage in the business of selling used automobiles in the USA and Dominican Republic. The Company\\u2019s physical address is Calle Duarte, No. 6 Sosua, Dominican Republic. On May 31, 2018, as a result of a private transaction, the control block of voting stock of this company, represented by 2,985,000 shares of common stock, has been transferred from Ramon Perez Conception to Greenwich Holdings Limited, and a change of control of Antilia Group, Corp. (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) has occurred. On November 1, 2018, the Company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles in the United States and Dominican Republic. On December 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Capital Contribution Agreement (the \\u201cAgreement\\u201d) with its president and principal shareholder, Robert Qin Peng (\\u201cPeng\\u201d). Under the terms of the Agreement, Peng contributed certain assets of eVeek, LLC (\\u201ceVeek\\u201d), a developer of iOS and Android applications and games, to our company, in exchange for the issuance of an addition 8,000 shares of common stock of our company to Peng (the \\u201cAcquisition\\u201d). To determine the number of shares received by Peng in connection with such contribution, our company valued the contributed eVeek assets at $40,000 and divided this amount by a price per share equal to $5.00, which represents the most recent price per share for trades of the Company\\u2019s common stock on the Over-the-Counter Quotation system in which the Company\\u2019s common stock is quoted. In connection with the Agreement, our company assumed certain ongoing responsibilities of eVeek, including maintaining Apple and Google developer licenses. The assets contributed to our company consist of a significant portion of the assets used in the operation of the eVeek business, with the exception of one application on eVeeks\\u2019 Google Play account and three applications on eVeeks\\u2019 iTunes account. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (September 19, 2016) resulting in an accumulated deficit from continued operations of $69,378 and retained earnings from discontinued operations of $2,400 as of January 31, 2019, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company\\u2019s year-end is January 31. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net (loss). Cash and Cash Equivalents All of the cash is maintained with the Bank of America, one of the major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with this bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed on demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is received typically on the 21st or 22nd of the subsequent month. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis. During the year ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the Company recognized no bad debt or allowance. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first out (\\u201cFIFO\\u201d) method. During the year ended January 31, 2019, the Company sold an automobile on consignment basis with a book value of $4,320 for $4,820, with the gross profit of $500 recorded under net income from discontinued operations with the Company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles on November 1, 2018. Depreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. The depreciation and amortization methods are designed to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in years, of the respective assets as follows: Computer Software 3 Years During the year ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the depreciation cost was $400 and $367, respectively. Related Parties The Company follows ASC 850, \\u201cRelated Party Disclosures,\\u201d for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions (see Note 4). Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in accordance with ASC 606,\\u201dRevenue Recognition\\u201d. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation Revenue related to multi-media downloads is recognized when the above criteria are met. During the year ended January 31, 2019, the Company recognized sales revenue from mobile applications of $576. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FASB ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 \\u201cIncome Taxes\\u201d. Pursuant to ASC 740 deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. ASC 740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At January 31, 2019, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, \\u201cEarnings per Share\\u201d which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018. Currencies The Company\\u2019s reporting and functional currencies are both the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense). Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company. NOTE 4 - ADVANCE FROM DIRECTOR In support of the Company\\u2019s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. Since September 19, 2016 (Inception) through January 31, 2019, the Company\\u2019s sole officer and director loaned the Company $31,538 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. As of January 31, 2019, the amount outstanding was $31,538. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. On December 3, 2018, the Company acquired receivable from related party from the collection of accounts receivable on the multi-media downloads of $56,164. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the Company recorded receivable - related party of $56,164 and $0, respectively.

The net income and loss from the discontinued operations in the financial statements reflected the operation results from the mobile operations. NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, \\u201cIncome Taxes.\\u201d Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cAct\\u201d) resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company\\u2019s financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019 reflect certain effects of the Act which includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% as well as other changes. The components of the Company\\u2019s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, are as follows: As of January 31, 2019, utilization of the NOL carry forwards, which will begin to expire between 2037 and 2039, of $66,978 for federal income tax reporting purposes, may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d). These ownership changes may limit the amount of the NOL carry forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an \\u201cownership change\\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Tax returns for the years ended 2017 through 2019 are subject to review by the tax authorities.

            ". WIGI4YOU, INC. June 30, 2016 REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wigi4you, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of as June 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Respectfully submitted, Weinberg & Baer LLC Baltimore, Maryland September 27, 2016 WIGI4YOU, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2016 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose. Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas around the United States and Canada. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company’s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements. Revenue recognition The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”. Revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues on sales of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement. The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price. If the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Advertising Advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Capital Stock The Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. NOTE B - GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above. NOTE C - COMMON STOCK On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. As of June 30, 2016 the Company has received $41,000 from investors for 1,640,000 shares of common stock to be issued. The shares were subscribed as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC to register and sell 2,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.025 per share. NOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On July 22, 2014, a Director of the company paid $555 to Thomas Puzzo towards his accounts payable due. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. NOTE E - INCOME TAXES For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $17,566 at June 30, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2034. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes as follows: Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015: Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17,566 for federal income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of June 30, 2016. NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENT During August 2016, Company received $9,000 from investors for 360,000 shares of common stock to be issued. On September 21, 2016, Company issued 2,000,000 shares to various investors at a price of $0.025 per share against the share application money received.\n",

June 30, 2016 REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wigi4you, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of as June 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Respectfully submitted, Weinberg & Baer LLC Baltimore, Maryland September 27, 2016 WIGI4YOU, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2016 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose. Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas around the United States and Canada. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company’s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements. Revenue recognition The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”. Revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues on sales of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement. The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price. If the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Advertising Advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Capital Stock The Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. NOTE B - GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above. NOTE C - COMMON STOCK On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. As of June 30, 2016 the Company has received $41,000 from investors for 1,640,000 shares of common stock to be issued. The shares were subscribed as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC to register and sell 2,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.025 per share. NOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On July 22, 2014, a Director of the company paid $555 to Thomas Puzzo towards his accounts payable due. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. NOTE E - INCOME TAXES For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $17,566 at June 30, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2034. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes as follows: Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015: Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17,566 for federal income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of June 30, 2016. NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENT During August 2016, Company received $9,000 from investors for 360,000 shares of common stock to be issued. On September 21, 2016, Company issued 2,000,000 shares to various investors at a price of $0.025 per share against the share application money received.\"\"\"\n",

              "'The financial statement provided indicates that the company has been experiencing a loss since its inception. This means that the expenses have exceeded its revenues over the years, resulting in a negative net income. The company has incurred operating costs that have contributed to its overall financial performance. Additionally, the statement mentions that it has been incurring losses since its establishment on June 30.  Expenses mentioned in the statement refer to the costs incurred by the company in running its operations. These expenses include operating expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, and other overhead costs. It is important to note that these expenses are deducted from the revenue to calculate the company\\'s net income or loss for the specified period to determine the overall profitability of the business.   The statement also mentions liabilities related to debt securities bought with borrowed funds. Liabilities may include accounts payable, loans, accrued expenses, and long-term debts that need to be settled in the future. The mention of \"current liabilities\" suggests that they are obligations that are due within one year and are classified as of the specified date. In this case, the company owes $4,000 in current liabilities, indicating that it owes money that needs to be paid off within a relatively short period, usually within a year.'"

Although they do not yet have a sufficient cash flow to meet their business objectives, there is \"substantial doubt\" about the company\\'s ability to go on as going-forward. The company has not been profitable since its inception and it has suffered an annual operating loss every year since then. The cash resources are insufficient to fulfill its business goals. There are numerous other factors that contribute to the substantial doubt over the Company\\'s solvency. In order to make money, the company earns revenue through advertising, subscriptions, and sales of services. It does not generate enough profit to pay its operating expenses. The revenues from these sources are not reliable, however, and may prove insufficient to fund its operations. Therefore, it must resort to financing its operations through capital markets such as private equity or public offerings of its stock.

MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Magna-Lab Inc. and Subsidiary Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Magna-Lab Inc. and Subsidiary (collectively, the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of February 28, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\\u2019 deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended February 28, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\u201cconsolidated financial statements\\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at February 28, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended February 28, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, will require additional capital to fund its current operating plan, and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\\u2019s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ RBSM LLP We have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 2016. New York, NY June 12, 2019 MAGNA-LAB INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. MAGNA-LAB INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND GOING CONCERN: Company Activities - Magna-Lab Inc. and Subsidiary (collectively, the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) is focused on engaging in a \\u201creverse merger\\u201d transaction with an unrelated business that could benefit from the Company\\u2019s public reporting status. Additional activities have included preserving cash, attempting to raise capital to support its activities and continuing its public reporting. The Company was previously engaged in research, development and commercialization activities until it ceased such activities during the period September 2002 through March 2003 since the Company was unable to secure financing to support its planned activities. The Company\\u2019s efforts to enter into a strategic arrangement or to seek other means to realize value for its cardiac diagnostic technologies through sale, license or otherwise have been unsuccessful and therefore, in January 2017, the Company sold such technology to its President and CEO in exchange for relief from certain liabilities. Going Concern Consideration - As indicated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, at February 28, 2019, the Company had approximately $4,000 in cash and approximately $1,664,000 in negative working capital and stockholders\\u2019 deficit. For the year ended February 28, 2019, the Company had a net loss of approximately $148,000 and utilized approximately $32,000 in cash for operations. Further, losses are continuing subsequent to February 28, 2019. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company is in need of additional financing in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on March 1, 2019. The Company\\u2019s plans to deal with this uncertainty are described above in \\u201cCompany Activities.\\u201d Management\\u2019s plans to raise capital or merge with an unrelated business have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that management\\u2019s plans can be realized at all. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue operations as a going concern. No adjustment has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cUS GAAP\\u201d). All dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Magna-Lab Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cardiac MRI, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at February 28, 2019 and 2018. Income Taxes - The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of US GAAP in accounting for income taxes. The Company uses the asset and liability approach to financial reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts and are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company also complies with US GAAP in accounting for uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is \\u201cmore likely than not\\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Based on its analysis, the Company has determined that it has not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of February 28, 2019 and 2018. However, the Company's conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and other expenses, respectively. No interest expense or penalties have been recognized as of and for the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. Generally, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for years before 2015. Net Loss Per Share - The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of US GAAP in reporting its earnings per share. Net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of Class A Common and Class B Common shares outstanding. Basic (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. In the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, there were no options, warrants or derivative securities outstanding. Therefore, basic and diluted loss per share were the same for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under US GAAP, approximate the carrying amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets. Use of Estimates and Assumptions - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires the Company\\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can, and in many cases will, differ from those estimates. Stock-Based Compensation - The Company complies with the US GAAP accounting and reporting requirements for its Share-Based Payments. US GAAP requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Stock awards to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for based on an estimate of their fair value at the time of grant and, in the instance of options and warrants, are based upon a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with generally the following weighted-average assumptions: risk free rate of 5%; no dividend yield; option lives of five to nine years and expected volatility in excess of 200%. Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements - The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Subsequent Events - Management has evaluated subsequent events to determine if events or transactions occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, require potential adjustment to or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements and has concluded that all such events that would require recognition or disclosure have been recognized or disclosed. NOTE 3 - ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS: During the year ended Fevruary 28, 2018, accrued liabilities and accounts payable to various parties totaling approximately $74,000 were settled by our principal stockholder or its affiliates and such amounts are now payable to that principal stockholder (MALLC, see Note 4). The Company intends to make a proposal to various of its significant outstanding creditors to convert all amounts outstanding to them into common stock of the Company. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, accrued expenses includes approximately $18,000 payable to a third party, guaranteed by our principal shareholder, for amounts paid to an account payable in October 2007 on our behalf. This amount was repayable if the proposed merger transaction with this party was not completed. This party subsequently merged with another entity and abandoned its possible transaction with the Company, however there has not been a demand for repayment of this amount. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, accounts payable also includes approximately $14,000 related to certain pre-1997 accounts payable (Note 8). Some of the amounts recorded as accounts payable or accrued liabilities may have passed the statute of limitations for purposes of the counterparty seeking recovery of such monies. The Company has not undertaken a formal study to evaluate recorded payables past the statute of limitations for purposes of possible write-off of such payables. NOTE 4 - NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY: During the two years ended February 28, 2019, the Company has received an aggregate of approximately $89,000 of proceeds under notes payable to its majority shareholder, Magna Acquisition LLC (\\u201cMALLC\\u201d) and MALLC has paid approximately $74,000 of liabilities of the Company on our behalf, raising the principal amount outstanding under such notes to an aggregate of $687,250 and $653,750, respectively, (plus accrued interest of approximately $598,000 and $497,000, respectively) at February 28, 2019 and 2018. Such notes are unsecured and mature, by their terms, 120 days from issuance. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, approximately $679,650 and $566,000, respectively, face amount of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand. Such notes bear interest at 12% per year and such interest increases to 15% per year once the note is past its due date. Interest expense on such notes aggregated approximately $101,000 and $86,000 in the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Subsequent to February 28, 2019 on May 20, 2019 a director of the Company who is also the managing member of MALLC loaned an additional approximately $10,000 to the Company on the same terms as above except that the interest rate is 10% initially and increases to 12% upon default. The Company intends to make a proposal to MALLC and to the director who loaned money to the Company in May 2019 to convert all amounts outstanding to them (including overdue amounts) into common stock of the Company. NOTE 5 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT: Description of Class A and Class B Common Stock - The Class A and Class B common stock are identical in most respects except that: (i) the Class B common stock has five votes per share and the Class A common stock has one vote per share and, (ii) each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock and requires conversion to Class A for sale or transfer to a non-Class B stockholder and (iii) by understanding with an underwriter, no more Class B common stock can be issued. Holders of Class A and Class B common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends and, upon liquidation, are entitled to share ratably, as a single class, in the net assets available for distribution. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock are not redeemable, have no preemptive rights or cumulative voting power, and vote as one class, except in certain circumstances, in matters before the shareholders. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, 8,183 class B shares have been converted to Class A shares. Under an agreement with an underwriter, 10,000 shares of Class B common stock were forfeited by the holders based on performance measures that were not met. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2001, 2,698 of such forfeited shares were inadvertently released by the Company\\u2019s transfer agent; 1,376 of which have been returned. The Company has not been successful in recovering the remaining 1,322 shares. Principal Shareholder and Related Party Relationship - In a series of transactions consummated on October 31, 2005, MALLC acquired an aggregate of 607,727 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 56% of the Company\\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock at that time, and approximately 55% of the voting power represented by the Company\\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Stock at that time. Two directors of the Company and the Company\\u2019s Chief Financial Officer serve as sole managers of MALLC, with the ability to vote and dispose of such shares owned by MALLC by majority vote. See also Note 4. Stock Grant - In July 2008 the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $10,000 reflecting the fair value of 90,000 Class A common shares that were issuable to management at that time at the closing bid price of the Company\\u2019s stock. Because of cash constraints, the Company has not been able to issue such shares. However, for accounting purposes, the Company has accounted for such shares as though they have been issued. Stock Options and Warrants - There were no stock options or warrants issued or outstanding during the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018. The Company\\u2019s Stock Option Plan has expired. NOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cTCJA\\u201d), which significantly modified U.S. corporate income tax law, was signed into law. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate income taxation, including but not limited to the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and generally eliminating net operating loss carrybacks, allowing net operating losses to carryforward without expiration, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including changes to the orphan drug tax credit and changes to the deductibility of research and experimental expenditures that will be effective in the future). The Company has not recorded any provisional adjustments in the financial statements in accordance with its current understanding of the TCJA and guidance currently available as of this filing. At February 28, 2019 and February 29, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively, to offset future income subject to tax. These resulted in an estimated $3.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of federal and $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of state deferred tax assets at February 28, 2019 and February 29, 2018. A full valuation allowance has been established for these deferred tax assets since their realization is considered unlikely. The difference between the tax provision at the federal corporation tax statuary rate and the rate (zero) included in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements occurs because the Company has never had any taxable income nor the ability to utilize loss carryforwards. Changes in the ownership of a majority of the fair market value of the Company's common stock would likely limit or eliminate the utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards and credits. Although a formal Section 382 study to determine whether a change in control has occurred has not been completed, the Company believes, based upon limited analysis, that such changes may have occurred in 1997, 2000 and 2005. Such carryforwards and credits expire between 2019 and 2035. It is likely that any \\u201creverse merger\\u201d or settlement of existing liabilities with equity or other strategic transaction is likely to result in a change in control under Section 382. NOTE 7 - OTHER MATTERS: Rent expense - Rent expense for each of the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $5,000 and $12,000 under a lease which expired in July 2019. NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Litigation - The Company knows of no pending litigation against it. Discontinued MAGNA-SL Business and Related 1997 Restructuring; Legacy payables - Commencing in February 1997, the Company executed a plan of restructuring to reposition itself out of its prior activity and into the cardiac activities conducted until 2003. Beginning in October 1997, reorganization counsel offered the Company\\u2019s creditors the opportunity to settle liabilities due them at substantially reduced amounts. Most of the Company\\u2019s liabilities from that time were settled in this manner as described more fully in the Company\\u2019s Form\\u2019s 10-KSB for prior years\\u2019. Through the passage of time, few of the remaining balances have been settled and others have been written-off. Residual amounts at February 28, 2019, are discussed in Note 3. The Company was also exposed to potential litigation from agreements entered into in connection with such pre-1997 business activities. However, the Company believes that the passage of time and statutes of limitation have mitigated such exposures and as such the Company has not recorded liabilities for such contingencies. Further, as mentioned in Note 1, in January 2018, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with its CEO in which the CEO purchased the residual technology and other assets and assumed all liabilities associated with that business.\",\n          \"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Cartesian, Inc. Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cartesian, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders\\u2019 equity for the 52-week periods ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\u201cfinancial statements\\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week periods ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has continued to use cash in operating activities and as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, has a note payable of approximately $3.3 million that may be called for redemption by the holder without specific cash resources to meet this obligation. These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\\u2019s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\\u201cPCAOB\\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. CARTESIAN, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS See notes to consolidated financial statements. CARTESIAN, INC.

CARTESIAN, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations - Cartesian, Inc. (\\u201cCartesian\\u201d or the \\u201cCompany\\u201d), formerly known as The Management Network Group, Inc., was founded in 1990 as a management consulting firm specializing in providing consulting services to the converging communications industry and the financial services firms that support it. A majority of the Company's revenues are from customers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Western Europe. Cartesian's corporate offices are located in Overland Park, Kansas. Liquidity and Going Concern - To date, the Company's cash resources and cash flows from financing activities have been sufficient to allow the Company to continue its operations. However, during fiscal year 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $4.5 million. At December 30, 2017, the Company had approximately $0.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and negative net working capital of $44,000. The Company's current capital resources may not be sufficient to repay a promissory note payable to Elutions Capital Ventures S.\\u00e0 r.l, a subsidiary of Elutions, in an aggregate original principal amount of $3.3 million (\\\"Elutions Note\\\"), if it were to be called for redemption, and to fund the Company's operations going forward. The Elutions Note matures on March 18, 2019, but may be called for redemption by the holder at any time and is payable 30 days after it is called for redemption. The Company is not in default under the Elutions Note and does not have any reason to currently expect that the Elutions Note will be called for redemption, given that the Company is paying its debts as they become due (including making timely payments of interest on the Elutions Note), and a call by the holder of the Elutions Note would cause Elutions to no longer have the right to purchase shares of stock pursuant to the Tracking Warrant if the Elutions Note is called for redemption. Under the Tracking Warrant, Elutions has the right to purchase up to 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share. The Tracking Warrant expires March 18, 2020. See Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., for additional discussion related to the Elutions Note. On March 21, 2018, Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \\\"Merger Agreement\\\") with Cartesian Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\\\"Parent\\\" or \\\"CHLLC\\\") and Cartesian Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\\\"Merger Sub\\\"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \\\"Merger\\\") Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent's designee made a working capital loan to the Company of $1,000,000. In connection with the loan transaction, the Company issued the Working Capital Note to Parent's designee, Auto Cash Financing, Inc. that bears interest at an annual rate of ten percent (10%). The Working Capital Note is secured by a lien on all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (except certain assets that are pledged by the Company to Elutions Capital Ventures S.a. r.l), subordinate only to certain existing and permitted encumbrances. The Working Capital Note is due and payable in full on the earlier of (a) the closing of the Merger, (b) the date the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (subject to an extension of the due date in certain circumstances), or (c) September 30, 2018. The Company has no reason to believe that the Merger will not occur or that the Merger Agreement may be terminated, but if the Merger Agreement is terminated the Company would not have the ability to repay the loan without the infusion of new debt or equity capital. Under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $400,000 to CHLLC in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, for more information regarding these transactions. If the Elutions Note is called for redemption by the holder or if the Company realizes significant negative cash flows from operations, it will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Elutions has certain rights of first offer in connection with debt financings by us, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, if we obtain debt financing from other lenders, subject to certain exceptions, Elutions may require us to redeem the Elutions Note and to repurchase the shares of our common stock originally acquired by Elutions at a price based upon market prices over 15 trading days prior to the repurchase. In addition, Elutions has certain preemptive rights in connection with equity issuances by the Company, subject to certain exceptions, and Cartesian and its subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of Elutions, issue options, warrants or similar rights or convertible securities, other than with respect to certain excluded issuances. The Company is exploring alternatives to address its liquidity needs in the event the Elutions Note is called for redemption. However, there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. The Company's ability to secure new financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions. If financing is obtained through the sale of additional equity securities or debt securities with equity features, it could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders. If adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, \\\"Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern\\\", that requires management to assess conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the financial statements are issued. Management has concluded under ASU 2014-15 that the current circumstances as discussed above raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to generate additional cash from operations or obtain financing in addition to the working capital loan, or if the Company is unable to arrange financing to pay off the Elutions Note upon a call for redemption or the Company becomes required to repay the Working Capital Note prior to the Merger, the Company may be unable to fund its operations in the future. Although, the Company currently expects that such financing can be obtained if necessary, subject to market conditions and the Company's financial condition at the time the Company seeks such financing, provided that, if it is in the form of debt financing, such financing would be at a very high interest rate, or if it is in the form of equity financing, such financing would be on terms that would be highly dilutive to stockholders. However, there can be no assurances that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these actions or that these actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet the Company's current obligations. If the Company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, it may have to (i) seek protection under bankruptcy reorganization laws, or (ii) liquidate its assets and the values it receives for its assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty, including any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cartesian and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year - The Company reports its operating results on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis. The fiscal year end is determined as the Saturday ending nearest December 31. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were each 52-week fiscal years and were comprised of four 13-week quarters. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are referred to herein as fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As described in further detail below, significant estimates include the estimates of costs to complete used to recognize revenues on fixed fee contracts, estimates for fair value of Elutions, Inc. (\\u201cElutions\\u201d) instruments, estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability and identifiable intangible assets, estimates used to determine the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and estimates used to determine the recoverability of deferred contract costs. Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue from time and materials consulting contracts in the period in which its services are performed. In addition to time and materials contracts, the Company also has fixed fee contracts. The Company recognizes revenues on milestone or deliverables-based fixed fee contracts and time and materials contracts not to exceed contract price using the percentage of completion-like method described by Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\\"FASB\\\") Accounting Standards Codification (\\\"ASC\\\") 605-35,\\\"Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\\\" For fixed fee contracts where services are not based on providing deliverables or achieving milestones, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the period during which such services are expected to be performed. In connection with some fixed fee contracts, the Company may receive payments from customers that exceed revenues up to that point in time. The Company records the excess of receipts from customers over recognized revenue as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability to the extent it is expected to be earned within twelve months from the date of the balance sheet. The FASB ASC 605-35 percentage-of-completion-like methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of services completed, on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis, using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period. Due to the nature of these projects, developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include, but are not limited to, the availability of labor and labor productivity, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, and the impact of delayed performance. If changes occur in delivery, productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues, the Company revises its cost and revenue estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs, and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known. Although there was no revenue recognized related to sales of software for fiscal years 2017 or 2016, the Company provides post-contract support (\\\"PCS\\\") services on historical software sales, including technical support and maintenance services as well as other professional services not essential to the functionality of the software. For those contracts that include PCS service arrangements which are not essential to the functionality of the software solution, the Company separates the FASB ASC 605-35 software services and PCS services utilizing the multiple-element arrangement model prescribed by FASB ASC 605-25, \\\"Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements \\\". The Company separated the PCS service elements and allocated total contract consideration to the contract elements based on the relative fair value of those elements utilizing PCS renewal terms as evidence of fair value. Revenues from PCS services are recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the term of the support and maintenance agreement. Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market investments and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value because of their relatively short-term maturities. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost or acquisition date fair value less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets and is computed using the straight-line method, and capital leases, if any, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Asset lives range from three to seven years for furniture and fixtures, software and computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the life of the lease or useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 360, \\\"Property, Plant and Equipment.\\u201d No impairments were identified in any period presented. Managed Services Implementation Revenues and Costs - Managed service arrangements provide for the delivery of a software or technology-based solution to clients over a period of time without the transfer of a license or a software sale to the customer. For long-term managed service agreements, implementation efforts are often necessary to develop the software utilized to deliver the managed service. Costs of such implementation efforts may include internal and external costs for coding or customizing systems and costs for conversion of client data. The Company may invoice its clients for implementation fees at the go-live date of the underlying solution. Lump sum implementation fees received from clients are initially deferred and recognized on a pro-rata basis as services are provided. Specific, incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are deferred pursuant to FASB ASC 605-35-25 and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized to the extent that the Company believes the recoverability of the costs from the contract is probable. If a client terminates a managed services arrangement prior to the end of the contract, a loss on the contract may be recorded, if applicable, and any remaining deferred implementation revenues and costs would then be recognized into earnings generally over the remaining service period through the termination date. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, deferred implementation costs related to managed service contracts were $536,000 and $432,000, respectively. Unamortized deferred implementation costs were $482,000 and $318,000 as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, of which $176,000 and $266,000 were included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $306,000 and $51,000, respectively, were included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Research and Development and Software Development Costs - Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 985-20, \\\"Software - Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed\\\" and FASB ASC 350-40, \\u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software.\\u201d Capitalization of software development costs for products to be sold to third parties begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ceases when the product is available for general release. The Company capitalizes development costs incurred during the period between the establishment of technological feasibility and the release of the final product to customers if such costs are material. In addition, the Company capitalizes software development costs for internal use software that it does not intend to market to third parties but uses to deliver services. The establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management concerning certain external factors including, but not limited to, the date technological feasibility is reached, anticipated future gross revenue, estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, $374,000 and $467,000, respectively, of these costs were expensed as incurred. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, $287,000 and $436,000, respectively, of internal use software development costs were capitalized. Goodwill - The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, \\\"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.\\\" Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of the first fiscal month of the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The Company determines impairment by comparing the net assets of each reporting unit to its respective fair value. In the event a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In this situation, the Company must determine the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the reporting unit's fair value to each asset and liability of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured by the difference between the goodwill carrying value and the implied fair value. Due to a significant decrease in the Company\\u2019s stock price during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting units did not exceed their carrying value and therefore step two of the test was required. Based on the results of the second step of the goodwill impairment test (i.e., applying the income approach and market approach described below, the Company determined, as of July 2, 2016, that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value, which resulted in goodwill impairment of $10.8 million, representing all of that goodwill. See Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional discussion related to goodwill. Fair value of the Company\\u2019s reporting units is determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. The Company also considers the market approach to valuing its reporting units utilizing revenue and EBITDA multiples. The Company compares the results of its overall enterprise valuation as determined by the combination of the two approaches to the Company\\u2019s market capitalization. Significant management judgments related to these approaches include: \\u2022 Anticipated future cash flows and terminal value for each reporting unit - The income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows, including an estimate of terminal value. The projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in revenues and estimates of expected changes in operating margins. The Company\\u2019s projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated. Because management frequently updates its projections, the Company would expect to identify on a timely basis any significant differences between actual results and recent estimates. \\u2022 Selection of an appropriate discount rate - The income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yields as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. The discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants, and for that reason, the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis. It is possible that the discount rate can fluctuate from period to period. \\u2022 Selection of an appropriate multiple - The market approach requires the selection of an appropriate multiple to apply to revenues or EBITDA based on comparable guideline companies or transaction multiples. It is often difficult to identify companies or transactions with a similar profile in regards to revenue, geographic operations, risk profile and other factors. Intangible Assets - Identifiable intangible assets, resulting from the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities, consist of customer relationships, agreements not to compete, and a trade name. The Company amortizes the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated economic benefit period, from six months to four and one-half years. In accordance with FASB ASC 360, \\u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment,\\u201d the Company uses its best estimates based upon reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections to review for impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable. If the Company was to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset's remaining useful life, then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Additionally, information resulting from other events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable which would result in recognition of an impairment charge. No impairments were identified in any period presented. Income Taxes - The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company records the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits. The Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The measurement of any unrecognized tax benefit is based on management\\u2019s best judgment. The Company reviews these estimates and makes changes to recorded amounts of uncertain tax positions as facts and circumstances warrant. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation - Cartesian Ltd., the international operations of Cambridge Strategic Management Group, Inc., Farncombe France SARL, Farncombe Technology Limited, and Farncombe Engineering Services Limited conduct business primarily denominated in their respective local currency, which is their functional currency. Assets and liabilities have been translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses have been translated at exchange rates which approximate the average of the rates prevailing during each period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments totaled $6.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and is included in Total Stockholders\\u2019 Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of a subsidiary are re-measured at rates of exchange on the balance sheet date. Resulting gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in the Company\\u2019s results of operations. Realized and unrealized exchange losses included in the results of operations during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $332,000 and $535,000, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements requires bifurcation of certain embedded derivative instruments in certain debt or equity instruments, and measurement at their fair value for accounting purposes. A holder redemption feature embedded in the Company\\u2019s note payable requires bifurcation from its host instrument and is accounted for as a freestanding derivative. See Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc. and Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for discussion of this embedded derivative. Share-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for share-based payment awards using the provisions of FASB ASC 718, \\\"Compensation-Stock Compensation\\\". The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of service-based stock option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and compensation expense related to stock option grants is recognized on a graded vesting schedule over the vesting period. For stock options containing a market condition, the market conditions are required to be considered when calculating the grant date fair value. FASB ASC 718 requires selection of a valuation technique that best fits the circumstances of an award. In order to reflect the substantive characteristics of the market condition option award, a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model was used to calculate the grant date fair value of such stock options. Expense for the market condition stock options is recognized over the derived service period as determined through the Monte Carlo simulation model. For non-vested, performance-based stock awards, compensation expense is recognized based on management\\u2019s expectations with regard to achievement of certain performance and service conditions. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. Expense for the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straight-line basis over the implied service period of the award. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the restricted stock award agreement will be achieved, previously recognized compensation expense would be reversed in the period such a determination is made. For non-vested, service-based stock awards, compensation is recognized based on achievement of service conditions alone. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. Expense for the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a graded vesting schedule over the vesting period. See Note 5, Share-Based Compensation. Loss Per Share - The Company calculates and presents earnings (loss) per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding excludes treasury shares held by the Company. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed in the same manner except that the weighted average number of shares is increased for dilutive securities. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 260, \\\"Earnings per Share,\\\" the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating the dilutive effect of employee stock options, non-vested shares and warrants. The employee stock options, non-vested shares and warrants will have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when average market value of the underlying Company common stock during the respective period exceeds the assumed proceeds. For share-based payment awards with a performance condition, the Company must first use the guidance on contingently issuable shares in FASB ASC 260-10 to determine whether the awards should be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the reporting period. For all non-vested performance-based awards, the Company determines the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable at the end of the reporting period if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. In applying the treasury stock method, assumed proceeds include the amount, if any, the employee must pay upon exercise, the amount of compensation cost for future services that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the options and the vesting of non-vested shares. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, approximately 78,000 and 43,000 shares, respectively, related to outstanding stock options, non-vested shares and warrants that otherwise would have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation were not included because they would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss for those periods. Accounts Receivable - The Company has entered into agreements with third-party financial institutions under which it can selectively elect to transfer to the financial institutions accounts receivable with certain of the Company\\u2019s largest, international customers on a non-recourse basis. These agreements give the Company optionality to convert outstanding accounts receivable to cash. For transfers of accounts receivable under these agreements that qualify as sales, the Company applies the guidance in ASC 860, \\u201cTransfers and Servicing - Sales of Financial Assets\\u201d, which requires the derecognition of the carrying value of those accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognition of a loss on the sale of an asset in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $11.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively, of accounts receivable transferred pursuant to these agreements qualified as sales of receivables and the carrying amounts were derecognized. The loss on the sale of these accounts receivable recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss was approximately $47,000 and $75,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, the Company entered into a Factoring Agreement (\\\"Factoring Agreement\\\") with RTS Financial Service, Inc. (\\\"RTS\\\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Factoring Agreement, the Company may offer for sale, and RTS may purchase, certain accounts receivable of the Company on an account by account basis (such purchased accounts, the \\\"Purchased Accounts\\\"). Under the Factoring Agreement, upon purchase RTS becomes the absolute owner of the Purchased Accounts, which are payable directly to RTS, subject to certain repurchase obligations of the Company. Proceeds from transfers under the Factoring Agreement reflect the face value of the account receivable less a factor\\u2019s fee. The factor\\u2019s fee is computed on a daily basis until the amount of the Purchased Account is paid to RTS, and equals the amount of the Purchased Account multiplied by the sum of the prime rate then in effect plus 6.49% divided by 360. Upon purchase of a Purchased Account, RTS will pay to the Company the amount of the Purchased Account, less a reserve of 20% of that amount, which reserve (less the total fee calculated) is payable to the Company upon collection of the Purchased Account by RTS. The fee is recorded as interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the period the fee becomes payable. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company factored $7,400,000 and $3,000,000, respectively, of accounts receivable under the Factoring Agreement and recognized a liability of $1,917,000 and $768,000, respectively, which is recorded as Secured borrowing in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Until received, the reserve amount withheld at the time of transfer is recorded as a receivable and is included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amount recorded as a receivable for the reserve withheld by RTS was $381,000 and $154,000. The amount of fees recorded as interest expense were $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 and were immaterial for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Also in 2016, Cartesian Limited, a U.K. subsidiary of Cartesian, Inc., entered into an Invoice Discounting Agreement, a Debenture (security agreement) and certain related agreements (collectively, the \\\"Agreement\\\") with RBS Invoice Finance Limited (\\\"RBS\\\"). In April 2017, the Company entered into agreements with RBS to include Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd. and Farncombe Technology Limited as companies that could assign eligible accounts receivable to RBS. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Cartesian Limited, Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd., and Farncombe Technology Limited may assign to RBS certain eligible accounts receivable (such purchased accounts, the \\\"U.K. Purchased Accounts\\\"). The Agreement has a maximum funding level of \\u00a33,000,000 with respect to Cartesian Limited, a combined \\u00a31,000,000 maximum funding level with respect to Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd. and Farncombe Technology Limited, and a combined \\u00a33,000,000 maximum funding level with respect to the three entities. At the time of the purchase of a U.K. Purchased Account, RBS will make an initial payment to the applicable entity of no more than 50% of the U.K. Purchased Account. Upon collection of a U.K. Purchased Account, RBS will pay to the applicable entity the amount of the U.K. Purchased Account, less the initial payment and a discounting charge. The discounting charge is computed on a daily basis until the amount of the U.K. Purchased Account is paid to RBS, and equals the amount of the U.K. Purchased Account multiplied by the sum of the National Westminster Bank Plc base rate then in effect plus 1.75% divided by 365. The Agreement for Cartesian Limited includes a fixed fee service charge of \\u00a3833 per month and the agreement for Farncombe Engineering Services Ltd. includes a fixed fee service charge of \\u00a3250 per month. The agreements have loan concentration limits regarding the obligors on U.K. Purchased Accounts. The discounting charges are recorded as interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the period the fee becomes payable. The entities' obligations under the agreements are secured by certain assets of the entities, including all equipment and intellectual property of the entities, all stock of subsidiaries held by them and certain accounts receivable. Each of the three entities guarantees the obligations of the other entities. Under the Agreement, Cartesian Limited's net worth, as measured by issued share capital and retained earnings, less all intangible assets, may not fall below \\u00a37,500,000 in any 12 month period. RBS may require the applicable entity to repurchase U.K. Purchased Accounts upon a number of specified events, including if the entity breaches or defaults on any of its obligations under the Agreement or if in the case of Cartesian Limited it fails to meet the net worth requirement. The entities are in compliance with those obligations and Cartesian Limited meets the net worth requirement. The agreements have an initial term of 12 months and continue after the initial term until terminated by either the applicable entity or RBS. Each entity may terminate its agreement at any time during the initial term upon approval of RBS or upon six months' notice of intent to terminate (three months' notice in the case of the Farncombe entities). RBS may terminate the agreements upon certain other events or conditions included in the agreements. During fiscal year 2017, the entities factored $26.3 million under the agreements and as of December 30, 2017 recognized a liability of $2.5 million which is recorded as Secured borrowing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No amounts were factored under the agreements during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Inventory - In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 330, \\u201cInventory,\\u201d the Company\\u2019s inventory is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $0.2 million and $0.4 million in inventory, respectively, all of which was finished goods. All of the inventory was purchased in July 2014 from Elutions, Inc. (\\u201cElutions\\u201d), which owns more than five percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The net realizable value of the inventory was determined using the indirect cost approach. As a result of the evaluation of lower of cost or market, the Company recorded impairments of its inventory value of $0.2 million and $0.3 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company recorded an inventory adjustment of $0.3 million in Cost of Services related to a provision in the general framework agreement between the Company and Elutions (see Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc.), that states if the Company had not sold 75% of such inventory acquired from Elutions within one year after acquisition, Elutions is required upon request of the Company to source its requirements for future projects in the U.S. or U.K. from such inventory subject to a 10% discount against the Company\\u2019s purchase price until the Company has exhausted such inventory. In fiscal 2015, the Company requested that Elutions source its requirements for future projects from the inventory that was acquired by the Company from Elutions in July 2014. Management continues to work with Elutions to utilize the inventory and changes in management\\u2019s expectations in future periods could further impact the net realizable value of the inventory. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\\\"ASU\\\") 2017-09, \\\"Scope of Modification Accounting\\\", which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements, provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. For all entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect the application of ASU 2017-09 will have a material impact on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, \\\"Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\\\", which will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and the ASU requires adoption on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the application of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, \\u201cImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\\u201d, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required on the balance sheet by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. A retrospective or prospective approach can be used for the cash flow statement and a prospective approach is required for the statement of operations. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in fiscal year 2017 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, \\u201cLeases\\u201d which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU 2016-2 will have on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value thereby simplifying the existing guidance which required entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under the current guidance, market is defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. The newly issued guidance eliminates the requirement to determine replacement cost and defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The standard update intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of this new standard by one year and to permit early adoption beginning as of the original effective date of the new standard. The provisions of FASB ASU 2014-9 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and are to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company established an implementation team to evaluate and implement the new standard related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The Company provides consulting services and currently recognizes revenue from time and materials consulting contracts in the period in which its services are performed. In addition to time and materials contracts, the Company also has fixed fee contracts. The Company recognizes revenues on milestone or deliverables-based fixed fee contracts and time and materials contracts not to exceed contract price using the percentage of completion-like method at point of sale or delivery. We are completing an analysis of revenue streams and expect to combine a majority of contracts into various portfolios under the practical expedient permitted by ASU 2014-9. We currently expect to finalize our accounting policy during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and implement any necessary changes to processes and controls prior to adoption of the new standard. The Company expects to use the modified retrospective adoption method. Upon adoption, the Company will present expanded disclosure in accordance with the requirements of the standard. Based upon its analysis to date, the Company does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate the impacts of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the preliminary assessments are subject to change. 2. ACQUISITION On July 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the \\u201cPurchase Agreement\\u201d) and completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Farncombe France SARL, an entity formed under the laws of France, and Farncombe Technology Limited, a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales (collectively, the \\u201cFarncombe Entities\\u201d). The Farncombe Entities operate primarily in the U.K. and Europe and are in the business of providing strategic consultancy, content security, testing and implementation services for broadcast and broadband internet digital television. Farncombe\\u2019s experience in these areas along with Cartesian\\u2019s strategic, operational and technical capabilities in serving global service providers strengthens the Company\\u2019s ability to support convergence and quad play offerings in this growing market. The total purchase price, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, was \\u00a34,360,620 pounds sterling (approximately US$6.8 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) comprised of: \\u2022 Cash paid at the closing in the amount of \\u00a3654,093 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) which was funded from our available cash on hand and represents 15% of the purchase price. \\u2022 \\u00a31,308,186 pounds sterling (approximately US$2.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) settled by the issuance of 588,567 shares of Company common stock at the closing which equals 30% of the purchase price. The number of shares issued at the closing was calculated using a volume-weighted average share price for Company common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of the signing of the Purchase Agreement and based upon the average pounds sterling to dollar exchange rate recorded by the Financial Times for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement. The share price resulting from this calculation was \\u00a32.22 pounds sterling per share (US$3.46 per share). \\u2022 Additional consideration in the amount of \\u00a3654,093 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000 = US$1.556 as of July 21, 2015) which represents 15% of the purchase price, payable after the closing in accordance with the Purchase Agreement upon determination of the net working capital of the Farncombe Entities as prescribed in the Purchase Agreement, and as adjusted based upon the relative amounts of the net working capital of the Farncombe Entities as of May 31, 2015 and the closing and as compared to the target amount of net working capital as provided in the Purchase Agreement. \\u2022 Earn-out consideration (the \\u201cEarn-Out\\u201d) which was payable in cash and/or shares of Company common stock as elected by each Seller in the Purchase Agreement and represents 40% of the purchase price as described below. On April 17, 2017, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the \\u201cLetter Agreement\\u201d) with the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities (the \\u201cSellers\\u201d). In the Letter Agreement, the parties agreed to a final determination of the Earn-Out and the consideration payable related to net working capital as adjusted, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay to Sellers an additional amount equal to any amount received by the Company following the date of the Letter Agreement in respect of repayment of a loan of \\u20ac50,000 (approximately US$59,000 based on an exchange rate of \\u20ac1.000 = US$1.191 as of September 30, 2017) made to a third party by Farncombe Technology Limited prior to the closing under the Purchase Agreement. The parties also agreed that the Earn-Out target was expected to be achieved, and that the Company would pay 100% of the Earn-Out consideration described above to the Sellers. The Company also agreed in separate agreements that performance-based awards granted to two of the Sellers as employees of the Company based upon achievement of the Earn-Out would be paid in full. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to the Earn-Out consists of cash in an amount up to \\u00a3719,483 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000= US$1.320 as of July 31, 2017) and up to 461,055 shares of Company common stock (approximately \\u00a31,024,765 pounds sterling or US$1.3 million based on an exchange rate of \\u00a31.000= US$1.320 as of July 31, 2017) and based upon the value of the shares as described below. Amounts payable under the Earn-Out are based upon the amounts of specified revenues attributable to the Farncombe Entities after June 1, 2015 through July 22, 2017, as defined in the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the number of shares of Company common stock payable under the Purchase Agreement at the closing and pursuant to the Earn-Out was determined based on the volume weighted average share price for Company common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement and based upon the average pounds sterling to dollar exchange rate recorded by the Financial Times for the 30 days ending on the day before the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement. The earn-out consideration was paid in full during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2015 the Company paid approximately $2.1 million to the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities with respect to the consideration payable related to net working capital as adjusted pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. This represented payment of a portion of the purchase price in the amount of \\u00a3654,093 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.0 million) payable in accordance with the Purchase Agreement along with an additional \\u00a3743,753 pounds sterling (approximately US$1.1 million) related to the working capital adjustment for excess working capital under the Purchase Agreement. In March 2016, the Company paid additional amounts of approximately \\u00a3184,000 and \\u20ac12,000 (approximately US$0.3 million) to the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities with respect to net working capital as adjusted. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017, payments of \\u00a320,000 (approximately US$25,000) and \\u00a348,000 (approximately US$59,000), respectively, were paid to the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities with respect to net working capital as adjusted. Up until the effective date of the Letter Agreement, the Company had classified the Earn-Out liability as a Level 3 liability and the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was evaluated each reporting period with changes in its fair value included in the Company\\u2019s results of operations. During fiscal 2017, the change in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was an increase of $365,000 and during fiscal year 2016, the change in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was a decrease of $273,000. The changes in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. The balance of the Earn-Out liability as of December 31, 2016 was $1,903,000, which is recorded as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for discussion of the determination of fair value of the Earn-Out liability. 3. RELATED PARTY - STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AND INVESTMENT BY ELUTIONS, INC. Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc. On February 25, 2014, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the \\u201cInvestment Agreement\\u201d) with Elutions, a provider of operational business intelligence solutions. Under the Investment Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell shares of common stock to Elutions and to issue stock purchase warrants to Elutions, and the parties agreed that a subsidiary of Elutions would loan funds to a subsidiary of the Company. On March 18, 2014, the Company and Elutions completed the closing (the \\\"Closing\\\") of the transactions contemplated under the Investment Agreement. At the Closing, (a) the Company issued and sold 609,756 shares of common stock to Elutions at a price of $3.28 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000, (b) the Company's subsidiary, Cartesian Limited, issued the Elutions Note, a promissory note payable to Elutions Capital Ventures S.\\u00e0 r.l, a subsidiary of Elutions, in an aggregate original principal amount of $3,268,664, payable in equivalent Great Britain Pounds Sterling, and the Company issued to Elutions a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (Tracking) related to the Elutions Note to purchase 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share (the \\\"Tracking Warrant\\\"), and (c) the Company issued to Elutions a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (Commercial Incentive) pursuant to which Elutions can earn the right to purchase up to 3,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company at prices ranging from $3.85 per share to $4.85 per share based on the Company's financial results related to certain customer contracts obtained jointly by the Company and Elutions (the \\\"Incentive Warrant\\\"). The Incentive Warrant and the Tracking Warrant are referred to collectively below as the \\\"Warrants\\\". The Investment Agreement contains a number of agreements and covenants, including (i) certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the Elutions Note applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) an agreement of the Company to assign to Elutions certain customer contracts obtained jointly with Elutions if a competitor acquires control of the Company, (iii) confidentiality restrictions applicable to both parties, (iv) a standstill agreement of Elutions, (v) an agreement of the parties to negotiate in good faith for the purchase by Elutions of additional shares of Common Stock equal to 6.5% of outstanding shares from the Company or in open market purchases if Elutions then owns or is vested with the right to acquire 38.5% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, subject to any applicable stockholder approval requirements, (vi) the grant of a right of first offer to Elutions to loan funds to the Company in the future if the Company intends to incur or assume indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, (vii) a grant of pre-emptive rights to Elutions with respect to future issuances and sales of equity securities by the Company, subject to certain exceptions, (viii) the right of Elutions to designate one member of the Board of Directors of the Company if it meets certain ownership thresholds, and (ix) restrictions on the issuance by the Company of options, warrants or similar rights or convertible securities, other than with respect to certain excluded issuances. Promissory Note The Elutions Note issued at Closing by the Company's subsidiary, Cartesian Limited, in the aggregate original principal amount of $3,268,664, bears interest at the rate of 7.825% per year, payable monthly, and matures on March 18, 2019. The Elutions Note must be redeemed by Cartesian Limited upon notification by the holder at any time (the \\u201cHolder Redemption Option\\u201d) and may be prepaid by Cartesian Limited at any time after September 18, 2016. The obligations of Cartesian Limited under the Elutions Note are guaranteed by the Company pursuant to a Guaranty entered into by the Company at Closing and are secured by certain assets relating to client contracts involving Elutions pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into by the Company and Elutions at Closing. Amounts outstanding under the Elutions Note may be applied to the exercise price of the Company's common stock under the Tracking Warrant. Upon occurrence of an event of default, the Elutions Note would bear interest at 9.825% per year and could be declared immediately due and payable. Interest expense for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was approximately $254,000 and $259,000, respectively. Tracking Warrant Under the Tracking Warrant, Elutions may acquire 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share at any time and from time to time through March 18, 2020. The Company may require Elutions to exercise or forfeit the Tracking Warrant at any time (i) after 18 months if the trading price of the Company's common stock exceeds $5.50 per share for a specified period of time and the Company meets certain cash and working capital thresholds and (ii) after 30 months if the Company meets certain cash and working capital thresholds. To the extent amounts are outstanding under the Elutions Note, Elutions and the Company (if the Company is requiring exercise of the Tracking Warrant by Elutions as described above) may offset such amounts against the exercise price for shares of common stock acquired under the Tracking Warrant. The Tracking Warrant expires if the Elutions Note is redeemed upon exercise of the Holder Redemption Option. Incentive Warrant Under the Incentive Warrant, Elutions can earn the right to purchase up to 3,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company at prices ranging from $3.85 per share to $4.85 per share based on the Company's financial results as described below. The Incentive Warrant expires on March 18, 2020. The right to exercise the Incentive Warrant to acquire shares is subject to satisfaction of certain performance conditions based on revenues or cash received by the Company under customer contracts acquired jointly with Elutions through a five-year period from March 18, 2014 until March 18, 2019. The Incentive Warrant may vest upon satisfaction of the performance conditions during the five-year period. The number of shares of common stock for which the Incentive Warrant may vest during each fiscal quarter in the five-year period under the vesting provisions shall equal, without duplication, four percent of revenues recognized for such fiscal quarter or four percent of cash recognized or received by the Company during such quarter, for which revenues will be recognized in the future. In addition, the right to acquire shares may vest at the end of the five-year period for contracts that have been signed and with respect to which revenues are expected to be earned or cash is expected to be received after the end of the five-year period. The exercise price increases $0.25 per year for shares earned in each year of the five-year period and is payable in cash, provided that Elutions has the right to utilize a cashless exercise procedure to acquire shares of common stock under the Incentive Warrant for a limited period of time each year after the right to acquire such shares vests. Any shares utilized to exercise such cashless exercise right will not reduce the maximum number of shares that may be earned and acquired under the Incentive Warrant. Additional Warrant Provisions Each of the Warrants has economic anti-dilution protection provisions which provide for adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock which may be acquired pursuant to the Warrants in the event of issuances of shares of common stock by the Company at a price less than the 30-day volume weighted average trading price at the time of issuance, subject to a number of exceptions. Each of the Warrants also permits Elutions (subject to certain exceptions) to purchase shares in future equity offerings made by the Company on a pro rata basis to all stockholders, with such participation right based upon the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the Warrant. Registration Rights At Closing, the Company and Elutions entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the \\\"Registration Rights Agreement\\\"), pursuant to which the Company has obligations to register for resale the shares of common stock issued under the Investment Agreement and the Warrants. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company granted certain piggyback registration rights to Elutions and agreed to file and maintain a resale shelf registration statement for the benefit of Elutions. The resale shelf registration was filed with the SEC on August 12, 2014 and was declared effective on August 26, 2014. Commercial Relationship The Investment Agreement and the agreements and instruments described above are part of a strategic relationship between the Company and Elutions. As part of the strategic relationship, the parties entered into certain commercial framework documents, including a Market Development Agreement and related Inventory Agreement, on February 25, 2014, and enter into client agreements and bilateral agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business outlining the terms of the parties' commercial relationship with respect to business development and providing products, solutions and services to clients. The parties have agreed to a term of five years, with automatic two-year renewals unless notice is given, and subject to termination rights in certain events. The Company has agreed to restrictions during the term and for two years thereafter in regard to solutions or services that are substantially similar to or competitive with certain solutions or services of Elutions, and each party has agreed not to hire the other party's employees during the same period. The parties have agreed on a general framework for pursuing, entering into and implementing customer contracts, which includes providing for joint and separate client pursuits and marketing on an initial and ongoing basis, procedures for contracting with clients, procedures for interface between the parties, limited exclusivity requirements of Elutions relating to identified prospects and clients of the Company, intellectual property rights of Elutions to its products and related restrictions, restrictions regarding use of confidential information, limitations on liability of the parties, independent contractor status of the parties, limitations on publicity by the parties, and dispute resolution, including arbitration. The parties intend that specific pricing and allocation provisions and other specific commercial terms will be included in individual client statements of work, subject to mutually agreed gross margin requirements for the benefit of the Company. The parties also agreed to a framework for certain initial inventory orders and reorders by the Company from Elutions, and related commitments, timing and pricing procedures, when the Company is the prime contracting party under certain client statements of work. With respect to the required initial inventory order, the Company was required to purchase $3.0 million of inventory from Elutions upon receiving a booked order for Smart Building Services of a certain size from a customer. As a result of a customer agreement entered into by the Company, during fiscal 2014, the Company acquired $3.0 million in inventory from Elutions to fulfill its initial inventory commitment. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has not sold or licensed any of the initial inventory acquired from Elutions and has not acquired any additional inventory from Elutions. Under the Market Development Agreement, if the Company had not sold 75% of such inventory acquired from Elutions within one year after acquisition, Elutions is required upon request of the Company to source its requirements for future projects in the U.S. or U.K. from such inventory subject to a 10% discount against the Company\\u2019s purchase price until the Company has exhausted such inventory. In fiscal 2015, the Company requested that Elutions source its requirements for future projects from the inventory that was acquired by the Company from Elutions in July 2014. Management continues to work with Elutions to utilize the inventory and changes in management\\u2019s expectations in future periods could impact the net realizable value of the inventory. See Note 1, Organization and summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of the inventory recorded with respect to our agreements with Elutions. Also under the Market Development Agreement, Elutions agreed to dedicate three full-time equivalent employees for the purpose of various functions related to the furtherance of the strategic alliance, and the Company agreed to fund the cost of the three full-time equivalent employees at a rate of $36,750 per month. Pursuant to the Market Development Agreement, the Company terminated the provision of the three full-time equivalent employees effective in March 2016. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, expense related to these dedicated employees was $98,500. In connection with the customer agreement entered into by the Company in 2014, the Company entered into a subcontract with Elutions. Under the subcontract, Elutions agreed to provide all services in accordance with the customer agreement except for project management services, to be provided by the Company. In January 2017, the Company entered into an amendment of the customer agreement and an amendment to the subcontract with Elutions. The amendments increase the number of customer sites deployed and extend the term of the original agreement. The Company currently estimates total additional license payments to Elutions under the amendment to the subcontract are approximately $0.4 million and that the total remaining license payments to Elutions under the original subcontract, as amended, are approximately $0.7 million over the term of the subcontract, with additional amounts potentially payable to Elutions based upon energy savings achieved by the customer. Such amounts are recorded as managed services implementation costs which are included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Elutions also agreed in the subcontract to provide all equipment required under the customer agreement, and the Company agreed to advance to Elutions $400,000 of the equipment deployment cost. The advance amount was paid to Elutions during fiscal 2014. Elutions is required to repay the advanced amount plus interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum. The funds are netted directly from the customer\\u2019s annual payments. During each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company paid $291,000 to Elutions related to annual payments under the subcontract, as amended. Each of these payments was net of $112,000 related to the advanced amount in each fiscal year 2017 and 2016. As of December 30, 2017, the balance remaining for the advance to Elutions was $100,000 which is included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, the balance remaining for the advance to Elutions was $200,000 of which $100,000 is included in Other current assets and $100,000 is included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting Treatment The Holder Redemption Option was determined to be an embedded derivative liability that was required to be bifurcated and recorded as a liability. In addition, the Company determined that the provision of the Elutions Note that permits Cartesian Limited to prepay the Elutions Note after 18 months if the trading price of the Company\\u2019s common stock exceeds $5.50 per share for a specified period of time and to prepay the Elutions Note after 30 months are each an embedded derivative asset that requires bifurcation (the \\u201cIssuer Call Option\\u201d). As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Issuer Call Option was determined to be immaterial. The carrying value of the Elutions Note as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $3,269,000 and as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 the fair value of the Elutions Note was $2,636,000 and $2,703,000, respectively. The Incentive Warrant and Tracking Warrant are accounted for as equity instruments. See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements for discussion of the determination of fair values. The vesting of the Incentive Warrant is contingent on services to be provided by Elutions and the achievement of performance conditions by Elutions. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, Elutions earned 20,911 and 27,194 vested shares under the Incentive Warrant and the Company recognized $57,000 and $53,000 of expense related to these vested shares, respectively. 4. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performed its impairment testing for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC 350, \\u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other.\\u201d The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit\\u2019s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit\\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value, the Company would be required to progress to the second step. In the second step, the Company calculates the implied fair value of goodwill and compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill on the Company\\u2019s balance sheet. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be required to be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of the first fiscal month of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. Due to a significant decrease in the Company\\u2019s stock price during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting units did not exceed their carrying value and therefore step two of the test was required. Based on the results of the second step of the goodwill impairment test (i.e., applying the income approach and market approach described under Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Polices - Goodwill), the Company determined, as of July 2, 2016, that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value, which resulted in goodwill impairment of $10.8 million, representing all of that goodwill. The facts and circumstances that led to the impairment of goodwill were primarily a result of the decreased market value of the Company based upon the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table summarizes the changes in the major classes of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 (in thousands). The identifiable intangible assets in the table above resulted from the July 2015 acquisition of the Farncombe Entities and their balances include the effects of foreign currency translation. This acquisition is discussed further in Note 2, Acquisition. Tradename, non-compete agreements and customer relationships carry amortization periods of six months, four and one-half years and three and one-half years, respectively. The amortization periods are based on the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets. Aggregate amortization expense related to intangible assets was $275,000 and $301,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to amortizing intangible assets as of December 30, 2017. 5. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options and stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Groups of employees or non-employee directors that have similar historical and expected exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted include risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected volatility factor, and expected dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the time of grant for a term equal to the expected life of the stock option; the expected life is determined using the simplified method of estimating the life as allowed under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110; and the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock price for a period of time equal to the expected life of the stock option. With the exception of the service-based non-vested share awards and the performance-based non-vested share awards discussed below, nearly all of the Company's share-based compensation arrangements utilize graded vesting schedules where a portion of the grant vests annually over a period of two to four years. The Company has a policy of recognizing compensation expense for awards with graded vesting over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. This policy has the effect of accelerating the recognition of expense when compared to a straight-line amortization methodology. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has two share-based compensation plans under which awards are outstanding, which are described below. No income tax benefits were recognized in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 due to the full valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets. In addition, no compensation costs related to these arrangements were capitalized in either year. The Company has historically issued and expects to continue to issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises, vesting of non-vested shares or purchases of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN The Company's Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, (the \\\"Equity Plan\\\"), is a stockholder approved plan, which provides for the granting of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to employees, and nonqualified stock options, nonvested stock, and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. The Equity Plan is scheduled to expire in June 2025. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has 1,295,585 shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options or for future awards under the Equity Plan. Stock Options Service-Based Stock Option Awards - Stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors. As of December 30, 2017, all options granted under the Equity Plan were non-qualified stock options. Service-based options generally become exercisable over a one to four-year period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years. A summary of the service-based stock option activity of the Company's Equity Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: The Company did not grant any service-based stock option awards during fiscal year 2017. During fiscal 2016, the Company granted a service-based stock option award for 37,500 shares of the Company's common stock having an exercise price of $1.10 per share. The stock option vests solely based on employee service over a three-year period. The Company recorded share-based compensation expense in connection with service-based stock option awards of $18,000 and $16,000 during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 30, 2017, there was $8,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based stock option awards, and this unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 10 months. As of December 31, 2016, there was $26,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based stock option awards. Market Condition Stock Option Awards - A summary of the market condition stock option activity under the Equity Plan, as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: On September 28, 2016, the Company granted non-qualified stock option awards for 125,000 shares of the Company\\u2019s common stock having an exercise price of $1.25 per share. On June 16, 2015 the Company granted a non-qualified stock option award for 200,000 shares of the Company\\u2019s common stock having an exercise price of $3.34 per share. These stock options will vest only if the price of the Company\\u2019s common stock reaches certain price targets, as follows: \\u2022 the stock option will vest with respect to 116,666 shares if at any time the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on each day during a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $4.00 per share; \\u2022 the stock option will vest with respect to an additional 116,667 shares if at any time the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on each day during a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $5.00 per share; and \\u2022 the stock option will vest with respect to an additional 91,667 shares if at any time the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on each day during a 30 consecutive trading day period equals or exceeds $6.00 per share. For stock options which contain market conditions, the market conditions are required to be considered when calculating the grant date fair value. FASB ASC 718 - \\u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation,\\u201d requires us to select a valuation technique that best fits the circumstances of an award. In order to reflect the substantive characteristics of the market condition option award, a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model was used to calculate the grant date fair value of such stock options. Monte Carlo approaches are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results. This approach allows the calculation of the value of such stock options based on a large number of possible stock price path scenarios. Expense for the market condition stock options is recognized over the derived service period as determined through the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value and derived service periods calculated for this market condition stock option award by vesting tranche for the market condition stock option awards granted in September 2016 were as follows: The fair value and derived service periods calculated for this market condition stock option award by vesting tranche for the market condition stock option awards granted in June 2015 were as follows: During fiscal years 2017 and 2016 the Company recorded $7,000 and $144,000 of share-based compensation expense in connection with this market condition stock option award. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there was $30,000 and $37,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to the market condition stock option awards, respectively, As of December 30, 2017, the unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 19 months. Non-vested Shares Service-Based Non-vested Share Awards - A summary of the status of service-based non-vested share awards issued under the Equity Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: On July 25, 2017, the Company granted 50,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest one year from the date of grant. Also on July 25, 2017, the Company granted 30,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest two years from the date of grant. On March 13, 2017, the Company granted 60,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest two years from the date of grant. On July 22, 2016, the Company granted 40,000 shares of service-based non-vested stock that vest one year from the date of grant. These service-based non-vested share awards are valued at the date of grant based on the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock, and are expensed using the straight-line method over the requisite service period (which is the vesting period of the award). During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $71,000 and $13,000 of stock-based compensation expense in connection with these service-based non-vested share awards. As of December 30, 2017, there is an estimated $78,000 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to these service-based non-vested share awards, and this unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a period of 13 months. As of December 31, 2016, there was $16,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based non-vested share awards. On July 22, 2016 and October 3, 2016, the Company granted 59,922 and 72,500 shares, respectively, of service-based non-vested stock to non-employees for services provided under consulting agreements which had three-year terms. In accordance with ASC 718, the fair value measurement date for these non-vested stock awards is the performance completion date. The fair value of the awards granted to the non-employee consultants was remeasured each reporting period based on their fair value at that time up to the performance completion date. The changes in fair value each reporting period were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Effective March 31, 2017, the consulting agreements were terminated and in accordance with the consulting agreements, all unvested shares of non-vested stock granted under those agreements vested as of March 31, 2017. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $85,000 and $25,000 of stock-based compensation expense in connection with these service-based non-vested share awards. Performance-Based Non-vested Share Awards - A summary of the status of performance-based non-vested share awards issued under the Equity Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: On July 22, 2015, the Company granted 58,940 shares of non-vested stock to two employees that vested in full on July 1, 2017 in proportion to the earn-out consideration paid pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities described in Note 2, Acquisition. On April 8, 2013, the Company granted performance-based non-vested share awards for a total of 800,000 shares of Common Stock to various executive officers and employees of the Company that vest in proportion to the ratio that the Company's \\\"Cumulative Net Non-GAAP EBITDA\\\" achieved over a four-year performance period compares to the Cumulative Net Non-GAAP EBITDA goal of $14 million. All 800,000 non-vested shares had a grant date fair value of $3.14 per share. The first potential vesting date was the Company's earnings release date for its 2014 first fiscal quarter and each subsequent potential vesting date was each of the Company's quarterly earnings release dates thereafter through the release date for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Shares not vested as of the release date for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 were forfeited. Share-based compensation cost for performance-based non-vested share awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of shares expected to be earned at the end of the performance period, based on the closing market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and is recognized as expense using the straight-line method over the performance period based upon the probable number of shares expected to vest. The Company estimates and excludes compensation cost related to awards not expected to vest based upon estimated forfeitures. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $144,000 of share-based compensation income and $88,000 of share-based compensation expense, respectively, in connection with performance-based non-vested share awards. As of December 30, 2017, there was no remaining unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to performance-based non-vested share awards. As of December 31, 2016, there was an estimated $46,000 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to performance-based non-vested share awards. 2000 SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK PLAN The Supplemental Stock Plan expired May 23, 2010. The outstanding awards issued pursuant to the Supplemental Stock Plan will remain subject to the terms of the Supplemental Stock Plan following expiration of the plan. The Supplemental Stock Plan provided the Company's common stock for the granting of nonqualified stock options to employees and was not subject to stockholder approval. Vesting and exercise provisions were determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted under the plan generally become exercisable over a period of up to four years beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years. A summary of the option activity under the Company's Supplemental Stock Plan as of December 30, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below: No awards have been granted under the Supplemental Stock Plan since it expired on May 23, 2010. There were no options exercised during fiscal year 2017 or fiscal year 2016. As of December 30, 2017 there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of stock options issued under the Supplemental Stock Plan. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\\\"ESPP\\\"), shares of the Company's common stock may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the enrollment period or on the last day of each six-month period over the subsequent two years. Employees may purchase shares through a payroll deduction program having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized net expense of $13,000 and $17,000, respectively, in accordance with FASB ASC 718 associated with the ESPP. 6. SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION Accrued payroll, bonuses and related expenses and Other accrued liabilities consist of the following (amounts in thousands): 7. BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Company identifies its segments based on the way management organizes the Company to assess performance and make operating decisions regarding the allocation of resources. In accordance with the criteria in FASB ASC 280 \\\"Segment Reporting,\\\" the Company has concluded it has three reportable segments: the North America segment, the EMEA segment and the Strategic Alliances segment. The North America and EMEA segments are both single reportable, operating segments that encompass the Company\\u2019s operational, technology and software consulting services inside of North America and outside of North America, respectively. Both reportable segments offer management consulting, custom developed software, and technical services. The Strategic Alliances reportable segment is a single, reportable segment that includes the Company\\u2019s world-wide commercial activities undertaken with third-party service or solutions providers. Management evaluates segment performance based upon income (loss) from operations, excluding share-based compensation (benefits) and depreciation. There were no inter-segment revenues during fiscal years 2017 and 2016. In addition, in its administrative division, entitled \\\"Not Allocated to Segments,\\\" the Company accounts for non-operating activity and the costs of providing corporate and other administrative services to all the segments, including, but not limited to, goodwill impairment, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, certain research and development costs, and costs related to the arbitration with the Company\\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional discussion of the arbitration costs. Summarized financial information concerning the Company's reportable segments is shown in the following table (amounts in thousands): Segment assets, regularly reviewed by management as part of its overall assessment of the segments' performance, include both billed and unbilled trade accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory, and certain other assets, if applicable. Assets not assigned to segments include cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current investments, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets and deferred tax assets, excluding deferred tax assets recognized on accounts receivable reserves, which are assigned to their segments. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 280-10, revenues earned in the United States and internationally based on the location where the services are performed are shown in the following table (amounts in thousands): In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 280-10, long-lived assets, excluding intangible assets, by geographic area are shown in the following table (amounts in thousands): Major customers in terms of significance to Cartesian's revenues (i.e. in excess of 10% of revenues) for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and accounts receivable as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows (amounts in thousands): Revenues from the Company's ten most significant customers accounted for approximately 82% and 77% of revenues in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Substantially all of Cartesian's receivables are obligations of companies in the communications, media and entertainment industries. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security on its accounts receivable. The credit risk on these accounts is controlled through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Company records bad debt expense based on judgment about the anticipated default rate on receivables owed to Cartesian at the end of the reporting period. That judgment is based on the Company's uncollected account experience in prior years and the ongoing evaluation of the credit status of Cartesian's customers and the communications industry in general. 8. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $1,250,000 and $994,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. 9. INCOME TAXES For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following (amounts in thousands): For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the income tax benefit (provision) consists of the following (amounts in thousands): During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded income tax benefits of $197,000 and $248,000, respectively. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2017 was primarily related to refinements of the projected 2016 U.K. tax liabilities. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2016 was primarily related to a $0.8 million domestic benefit recognized in connection with adjustments to domestic deferred taxes related to the impairment of goodwill amortized for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes netted with a $0.6 million international expense recognized in connection with the international valuation allowance in fiscal 2016. The Company has reserved all of its domestic and international net deferred tax assets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 with a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, \\u201cIncome Taxes,\\u201d which requires an estimation of the recoverability of the recorded income tax asset balances. Related to the going concern assertion in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company reserved all of its international net deferred tax assets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 with a valuation allowance. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had recorded $25.0 million and $36.6 million, respectively, of valuation allowances attributable to its domestic and international net deferred tax assets. The determination of recording and releasing valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is made, in part, pursuant to the Company\\u2019s assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable income against which benefits of the deferred tax assets may or may not be realized. Significant judgment is required in making estimates regarding the Company\\u2019s ability to generate income in future periods. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient income in future periods. In evaluating the ability to use its deferred tax assets, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence including the Company's past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent three fiscal years and the Company's forecast of future income. In determining future income, the Company is responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state, federal and international operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the underlying business. The following is a reconciliation between the benefit (provision) for income taxes and the amounts computed based on loss before income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate (amounts in thousands): The significant components of deferred income tax assets and the related balance sheet classifications, as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, are as follows (amounts in thousands): As of December 30, 2017, the Company has U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $89.7 million which begin expiring in 2020. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $50.7 million. These net operating losses expire at various times between 2018 and 2036. In addition, as of December 30, 2017, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $3.4 million all of which primarily have no expiration date. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has net foreign tax credits of $1.0 million. If unutilized, the expiration of these foreign tax credits is $317,000 and $689,000 in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. On December 22, 2017 the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changes the existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, as well as other changes. As a result of enactment of the legislation, the Company incurred a $13.1 million reduction to the gross deferred tax assets of the Company, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower corporate tax rates. There was not an impact to the tax provision related to the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Due to the going concern assertion and full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Company, the tax reform legislation has zero net effect on the Company\\u2019s deferred tax assets as a whole. There are no income tax effects of the tax reform legislation that for which the accounting is incomplete or that are reported as provisional amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company analyzes its uncertain tax positions pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC 740 \\\"Income Taxes\\\" that prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained based on its technical merit. If the tax position is deemed \\\"more-likely-than-not\\\" to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no recorded liability for uncertain tax positions. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2000. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has no income tax examinations in process. 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company utilizes the methods of fair value measurement as described in FASB ASC 820, \\u201cFair Value Measurements\\u201d to value its financial assets and liabilities, including the financial instruments issued in the transaction described in Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc. and the contingent consideration liability described in Note 2, Acquisition. As defined in FASB ASC 820, fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Recurring Fair Value Measurements The fair value of the Company\\u2019s Elutions Note and the Holder Redemption Option were determined using a binomial lattice model. (See Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., for further discussion of the Elutions Note and Holder Redemption Option.) The Holder Redemption Option was determined to be an embedded derivative liability that was required to be bifurcated and recorded as a liability. The Company has classified the Holder Redemption Option and Elutions Note as Level 3 liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the Holder Redemption Option are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company reassesses the fair value of this liability on a quarterly basis. Based on that assessment, the Company recognized a decrease of $337,000 and an increase of $18,000 in the fair value of this liability during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. To determine the fair value of the Holder Redemption Option, management evaluates assumptions that require significant judgment. Changes in certain inputs to the valuation model, including the Company\\u2019s period end stock price and stock volatility, can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value. The fair value recorded for the Holder Redemption Option may vary significantly from period to period. This variability may result in the actual liability for a period either above or below the estimates recorded in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements, resulting in significant fluctuations in other income (expense) as a result of the corresponding non-cash gain or loss recorded. The model requires the following inputs: (i) price of the Company\\u2019s common stock; (ii) the expected life of the instrument or derivative; (iii) risk-free interest rate; (iv) estimated dividend yield, and (v) estimated stock volatility. Assumptions used in the calculation require significant management judgment. The following table sets forth the Level 3 inputs to the binomial lattice model that were used to determine the fair value of the Elutions Note and the Holder Redemption Option: In addition, the Company determined that the provision of the Elutions Note that permits Cartesian Limited to prepay the Elutions Note after 18 months if the trading price of the Company\\u2019s common stock exceeds $5.50 per share for a specified period of time is an embedded derivative asset that requires bifurcation (the \\u201cIssuer Call Option\\u201d). As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Issuer Call Option was determined to be immaterial. Because the Company measures the Holder Redemption Option at fair value on a recurring basis, transfers, if any, between the levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 liabilities during fiscal years 2017 or 2016. In connection with the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities, the Company recorded a liability related to the Earn-Out portion of the purchase consideration. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had classified the Earn-Out liability as a Level 3 liability and the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was evaluated each reporting period and changes in its fair value were included in the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Earn-Out liability was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation using a risk-adjusted discount rate applied to management\\u2019s estimate of forecasted revenues that were eligible under the Earn-Out as described in the Purchase Agreement. To determine the fair value of the Earn-Out liability, management evaluated assumptions that require significant judgment. Changes in certain inputs to the valuation model, including the Company\\u2019s estimate of future revenues, can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value. On April 17, 2017, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with the former shareholders of the Farncombe Entities whereby the parties agreed to a final determination of the Earn-Out, that the Earn-Out target was expected to be achieved, and that the Company would pay 100% of the Earn-Out consideration described above to the Sellers. The Earn-Out was paid in full during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 2, Acquisition, for further discussion of the Earn-Out liability. Because the Company measured the Earn-Out liability at fair value on a recurring basis transfers, if any, between the levels of the fair value hierarchy were recognized at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 liabilities during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following (in thousands): The following table summarizes the changes to the fair value of the Holder Redemption Option which is a Level 3 liability (in thousands): Other Fair Value Disclosures The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the relatively short-term maturities of these financial instruments. 11. LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases office facilities, computer equipment and office furniture under various operating leases expiring at various dates through May 2022. Following is a summary of future minimum payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancellable lease terms at December 30, 2017 (amounts in thousands): Total rental expense, net of subtenant rents received, was approximately $1,922,000 and $1,872,000 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, $138,000 and $61,000 was recorded in cost of services, respectively, and $1,784,000 and $1,811,000 was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. The Company recorded $328,000 in rental income from subtenants during fiscal year 2017. There was no rental income from subtenants recognized in fiscal 2016. Rents received from subtenants were recorded as an offset to rental expense. In 2015, the Company took steps to discontinue use of its leased facilities in McLean, Virginia. The space is leased under an operating lease with a term expiring in July 2019 and is comprised of 4,823 square feet. Although the Company has clients in this geographic market, projects are performed from either client sites or other Company locations, and thus the space is not required or used by Company employees, and specifically not used for revenue-generating activities. In March 2017, the Company entered into a sublease for this facility. The sublease does not relieve the Company of its primary obligations under the original lease. We accounted for the discontinuation of use of this property in accordance with FASB ASC 420, \\u201cExit or Disposal Cost Obligations\\u201d and as such recorded a liability during fiscal 2015. As of December 30, 2017, a liability of $158,000 is recorded of which $128,000 is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and $30,000 is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, a liability of $185,000 is recorded of which $103,000 is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and $82,000 is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expense related to this liability is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The amounts recorded as of December 31, 2016, were calculated using probability-weighted cash flow analysis and represented the present value, calculated using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, of our remaining costs under the remaining term of the lease, net of estimated subleases we expected to obtain. 12. LETTERS OF CREDIT In connection with the leasing of office space, the Company provides security deposits in the form of two irrevocable letters of credit with financial institutions for the benefit of the respective landlords. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the required, total collateral amount was $103,000 and $103,000, respectively. The collateral deposited for these letters of credit is included in \\\"Other Noncurrent Assets\\\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. No obligation has been recorded in connection with the letters of credit on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is not subject to any material litigation, individually and in the aggregate, as of December 30, 2017. However, the Company may become involved in various legal and administrative actions arising in the normal course of business. These could include actions brought by taxing authorities challenging the employment status of consultants utilized by the Company. In addition, future customer bankruptcies could result in additional claims on collected balances for professional services near the bankruptcy filing date. When management has determined that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability had been incurred related to an action, claim or assessment and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company will record a liability for such estimated loss in the appropriate accounting period. The resolution of any of such actions, claims, or the matters described above may have an impact on the financial results for the period in which they occur. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company renewed an agreement under which it had a commitment to purchase a minimum of $412,000 in computer software over a three-year period. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company amended the agreement to include an additional commitment of $95,000 over a two-year period. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had an obligation of $181,000 remaining under this commitment. These amounts were paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 14. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On June 7, 2016, the Company\\u2019s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the Company\\u2019s previously announced stock repurchase program to extend the program through June 30, 2017. The program was initially authorized in February 2014 and was previously extended in June 2015. The program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $2 million of Company common stock. Under the program, repurchases may be made by the Company from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. The program expired on June 30, 2017. There were no share repurchases under the share repurchase program during fiscal years 2017 or 2016. 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company offers defined contribution plans to eligible employees. Such employees may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation in accordance with the plans\\u2019 guidelines. The plans provide for Company contributions that are subject to maximum limitations as defined by the plans. Company contributions to its defined contribution plans totaled $1.2 million and $1.4 million in the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Agreement and Plan of Merger On March 21, 2018, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \\\"Merger Agreement\\\") with Cartesian Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\\\"Parent\\\") and Cartesian Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\\\"Merger Sub\\\"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \\\"Merger\\\"). The proposed transaction is structured as a two-step transaction consisting of a first-step cash tender offer for outstanding shares of the Company's common stock followed by the second-step Merger. CHLLC and Merger Sub are affiliates of Blackstreet Capital Holdings. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will commence a cash tender offer (the \\\"Offer\\\") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.005 per share, of the Company (\\\"Company Common Stock\\\" or the \\\"Shares\\\") at a price per share equal to $0.40, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the \\\"Offer Price\\\"), subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. Upon satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement and applicable law) of specified conditions in the Merger Agreement (including receipt of any required affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares (the \\\"Company Required Vote\\\")), each Share remaining outstanding after consummation of the Offer (other than Shares owned directly by the Company or Merger Sub or Shares as to which appraisal rights have been perfected) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes. If 90% or more of the outstanding Shares are purchased in the Offer, the Merger may be effected by a resolution adopted by the Merger Sub's board of directors without the need for a meeting of the Company's stockholders. The obligations of Merger Sub to purchase Shares tendered in the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) a number of Shares must have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that, when added to the number of Shares (if any) then beneficially owned by Parent or its controlled affiliates (including Merger Sub), equals at least a majority of all Shares then outstanding (together with Shares underlying options as to which notice of exercise have been received prior to expiration of the Offer but not then issued); (ii) the absence of any order, applicable law or other legal restraints of an applicable governmental authority enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the proposed Merger; (iii) the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to specified materiality qualifications; (iv) compliance, in all material respects, by the Company with its covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; (v) the absence, since the date of execution of the Merger Agreement, of an event, change, effect, occurrence, circumstance or development, that individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and (vi) that the Merger Agreement has not been terminated. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this nature, including the obligation of the Company to (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to carry on its business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and (ii) comply with certain other negative operating covenants. The Merger Agreement also contains a customary \\\"no solicitation\\\" provision that, subject to certain exceptions, restricts the Company's ability to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or submission that could lead to a third-party takeover proposal or (ii) enter into, engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any nonpublic information relating to the Company to, or execute any agreement with, third parties in connection with a third-party takeover proposal. The no solicitation provision is subject to a \\\"fiduciary out\\\" that permits the Company, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations, to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) upon payment to Parent of the termination fee described below. In addition, prior to the Company Required Vote, the Company's Board of Directors (the \\\"Board\\\") may, among other things, change its recommendation that the Company's stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares in the Offer or otherwise approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger in connection with a Superior Proposal or to comply with its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company, subject to complying with the procedures in the Merger Agreement and payment of the termination fee described below. The Merger Agreement also contains certain customary termination rights for both Parent and the Company, including, among others, (i) the ability of either Parent or the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement if (A) a majority of the Shares have not been purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer within 20 business days after commencement of the Offer, or (B) the Merger is not consummated on or before July 31, 2018; (ii) the ability of the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations (including the right of Parent to make a more favorable offer within three days after receiving notice of the Superior Proposal), and to enter into an agreement for an alternative transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (iii) the ability of Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement due to a change in the recommendation of the Board or a breach of the \\\"no solicitation\\\" provisions by the Company, the failure of the Company to comply with its covenants in all material respects, or any inaccuracy of the Company's representations or warranties that would cause a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is required to pay Parent a termination fee of $400,000 upon termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, including if the Merger is prohibited or prevented by certain government actions, if Parent or the Company terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the Merger not being consummated by July 31, 2018, if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or if Parent terminates the Merger Agreement as described in clause (iii) above. Tender and Support Agreements As a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement, the Parent required that each of the Company's officers and directors enter into a Tender and Support Agreement in favor of Parent and Merger Sub. That agreement requires the Company's officers and directors to include, among other things, an irrevocable agreement to tender all of their Shares in the Offer. Rights Agreement On March 21, 2018, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2010, by and between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as amended, the \\\"Rights Agreement\\\") to provide that the rights issued under the Rights Agreement would be inapplicable to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Working Capital Loan Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent's designee made a working capital loan to the Company of $1,000,000. In connection with the loan transaction, the Company issued a Term Loan Note for Working Capital dated March 21, 2018 (\\\"Working Capital Note\\\") with Parent's designee, Auto Cash Financing, Inc. that bears interest at an annual rate of ten percent (10%). The Working Capital Note is secured by a lien on all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (except certain assets that are pledged by the Company to Elutions Capital Ventures S.a. r.l) pursuant to (i) a Security Agreement dated March 21, 2018 (\\\"Security Agreement\\\") among the Company, its U.S. subsidiaries, and Auto Cash Financing, Inc. and (ii) a Debenture dated March 21, 2018 among the Company' foreign subsidiaries and Auto Cash Financing, Inc. (the \\\"Debenture Agreement\\\"). The liens under the 2018 Security Agreement and the Debenture Agreement are subordinate only to Permitted Encumbrances as defined in the 2018 Security Agreement and any Permitted Security as defined in the Debenture Agreement. In connection with the preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements, an evaluation of subsequent events was performed through the date these audited consolidated financial statements were issued and, other than the events above, there are no other events that have occurred that would require adjustments or disclosure to the Company\\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements.\",\n          \"ANTILIA GROUP, CORP.

Notes to the Audited Financial Statements January 31, 2019 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS ANTILIA GROUP, CORP. (\\u201cthe Company\\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on September 19, 2016. We are a development stage company that plans to engage in the business of selling used automobiles in the USA and Dominican Republic. The Company\\u2019s physical address is Calle Duarte, No. 6 Sosua, Dominican Republic. On May 31, 2018, as a result of a private transaction, the control block of voting stock of this company, represented by 2,985,000 shares of common stock, has been transferred from Ramon Perez Conception to Greenwich Holdings Limited, and a change of control of Antilia Group, Corp. (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) has occurred. On November 1, 2018, the Company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles in the United States and Dominican Republic. On December 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Capital Contribution Agreement (the \\u201cAgreement\\u201d) with its president and principal shareholder, Robert Qin Peng (\\u201cPeng\\u201d). Under the terms of the Agreement, Peng contributed certain assets of eVeek, LLC (\\u201ceVeek\\u201d), a developer of iOS and Android applications and games, to our company, in exchange for the issuance of an addition 8,000 shares of common stock of our company to Peng (the \\u201cAcquisition\\u201d). To determine the number of shares received by Peng in connection with such contribution, our company valued the contributed eVeek assets at $40,000 and divided this amount by a price per share equal to $5.00, which represents the most recent price per share for trades of the Company\\u2019s common stock on the Over-the-Counter Quotation system in which the Company\\u2019s common stock is quoted. In connection with the Agreement, our company assumed certain ongoing responsibilities of eVeek, including maintaining Apple and Google developer licenses. The assets contributed to our company consist of a significant portion of the assets used in the operation of the eVeek business, with the exception of one application on eVeeks\\u2019 Google Play account and three applications on eVeeks\\u2019 iTunes account. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (September 19, 2016) resulting in an accumulated deficit from continued operations of $69,378 and retained earnings from discontinued operations of $2,400 as of January 31, 2019, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company\\u2019s year-end is January 31. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net (loss). Cash and Cash Equivalents All of the cash is maintained with the Bank of America, one of the major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with this bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed on demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is received typically on the 21st or 22nd of the subsequent month. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis. During the year ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the Company recognized no bad debt or allowance. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first out (\\u201cFIFO\\u201d) method. During the year ended January 31, 2019, the Company sold an automobile on consignment basis with a book value of $4,320 for $4,820, with the gross profit of $500 recorded under net income from discontinued operations with the Company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles on November 1, 2018. Depreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. The depreciation and amortization methods are designed to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in years, of the respective assets as follows: Computer Software 3 Years During the year ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the depreciation cost was $400 and $367, respectively. Related Parties The Company follows ASC 850, \\u201cRelated Party Disclosures,\\u201d for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions (see Note 4). Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in accordance with ASC 606,\\u201dRevenue Recognition\\u201d. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation Revenue related to multi-media downloads is recognized when the above criteria are met. During the year ended January 31, 2019, the Company recognized sales revenue from mobile applications of $576. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FASB ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 \\u201cIncome Taxes\\u201d. Pursuant to ASC 740 deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. ASC 740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At January 31, 2019, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, \\u201cEarnings per Share\\u201d which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018. Currencies The Company\\u2019s reporting and functional currencies are both the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense). Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company. NOTE 4 - ADVANCE FROM DIRECTOR In support of the Company\\u2019s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. Since September 19, 2016 (Inception) through January 31, 2019, the Company\\u2019s sole officer and director loaned the Company $31,538 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. As of January 31, 2019, the amount outstanding was $31,538. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. On December 3, 2018, the Company acquired receivable from related party from the collection of accounts receivable on the multi-media downloads of $56,164. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the Company recorded receivable - related party of $56,164 and $0, respectively. NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK The Company has 75,000,000 authorized common shares at $0.001 par value. Year Ended January 31, 2018 For the year ended January 31, 2018, the Company issued 1,305,000 shares of its common stock at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $26,100. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, the issued and outstanding common stock are 4,290,000 and 4,290,000, respectively. NOTE 6 - ACQUISITIONS OF NET ASSETS On December 3, 2018, the Company authorized the issuance of 8,000 shares of its common stock at $40,000 to acquire the net assets from eVeek, LLC summarized as follows: NOTE 7 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On November 1, 2018, the Company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles in the United States and Dominican Republic. The net income and loss from the discontinued operations in the financial statements reflected the operation results from the mobile operations. NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, \\u201cIncome Taxes.\\u201d Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cAct\\u201d) resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company\\u2019s financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019 reflect certain effects of the Act which includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% as well as other changes. The components of the Company\\u2019s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, are as follows: As of January 31, 2019, utilization of the NOL carry forwards, which will begin to expire between 2037 and 2039, of $66,978 for federal income tax reporting purposes, may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d). These ownership changes may limit the amount of the NOL carry forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an \\u201cownership change\\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Tax returns for the years ended 2017 through 2019 are subject to review by the tax authorities.

            ". WIGI4YOU, INC. June 30, 2016 REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wigi4you, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of as June 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Respectfully submitted, Weinberg & Baer LLC Baltimore, Maryland September 27, 2016 WIGI4YOU, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2016 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose. Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas around the United States and Canada. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company’s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements. Revenue recognition The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”. Revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues on sales of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement. The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price. If the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Advertising Advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Capital Stock The Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. NOTE B - GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above. NOTE C - COMMON STOCK On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. As of June 30, 2016 the Company has received $41,000 from investors for 1,640,000 shares of common stock to be issued. The shares were subscribed as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC to register and sell 2,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.025 per share. NOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On July 22, 2014, a Director of the company paid $555 to Thomas Puzzo towards his accounts payable due. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. NOTE E - INCOME TAXES For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $17,566 at June 30, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2034. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes as follows: Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015: Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17,566 for federal income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of June 30, 2016. NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENT During August 2016, Company received $9,000 from investors for 360,000 shares of common stock to be issued. On September 21, 2016, Company issued 2,000,000 shares to various investors at a price of $0.025 per share against the share application money received.\n",
            "The financial statement provided indicates that the company has incurred a loss since its inception. As of June 30, the company's financial position shows expenses related to liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n",
            "\n",
            "When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. This includes risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels, categorizing within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input available and significant to the fair value measurement, with Level 1 being the highest.\n",
            "\n",
            "The company also mentions liabilities in the form of debt securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less, which are considered cash equivalents. Additionally, the statement refers to recent accounting pronouncements made on June 10, which may have an impact on the company's financial reporting and disclosures.\n",

June 30, 2016 REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wigi4you, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of as June 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Respectfully submitted, Weinberg & Baer LLC Baltimore, Maryland September 27, 2016 WIGI4YOU, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2016 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose. Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas around the United States and Canada. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company’s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements. Revenue recognition The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”. Revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues on sales of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement. The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price. If the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Advertising Advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Capital Stock The Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. NOTE B - GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above. NOTE C - COMMON STOCK On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. As of June 30, 2016 the Company has received $41,000 from investors for 1,640,000 shares of common stock to be issued. The shares were subscribed as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC to register and sell 2,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.025 per share. NOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On July 22, 2014, a Director of the company paid $555 to Thomas Puzzo towards his accounts payable due. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. NOTE E - INCOME TAXES For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $17,566 at June 30, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2034. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes as follows: Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015: Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17,566 for federal income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of June 30, 2016. NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENT During August 2016, Company received $9,000 from investors for 360,000 shares of common stock to be issued. On September 21, 2016, Company issued 2,000,000 shares to various investors at a price of $0.025 per share against the share application money received.\"\"\"\n",

It has incurred an operating loss since inception. Cash requirements will relate to continual development of the business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In order to fund operations, the Company has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock. Fair Value accounting is used to calculate the fair value of all financial assets and liabilities. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain is reflected in income tax. Depreciation is computed on a straight line basis. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $17,566 and will expire in 2034. The company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.

This suggests that, while global attention can be useful for capturing long-term dependencies in general book summaries, its effectiveness may vary or even slightly impede performance on financial reports in this particular fine-tuning context, possibly due to the more structured and less narrative nature of financial documents compared to books. Nevertheless, the fine-tuned model still outperformed the base model."

        "**Dataset Size for Fine-tuning:** Due to computational resource limits and project timeframes, the fine-tuning process was carried out on just 6,331 data points. Expanding the training dataset may result in a more robust and generalised model that can manage the intricacies of financial text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sequence Length Constraints:** The model's input and target sequence lengths were limited to 8,000 and 256 tokens, respectively. Given that the underlying LED architecture can theoretically process up to 16,384 input tokens and that comprehensive financial summaries frequently require more than 256 tokens, increasing these limits in subsequent iterations may allow the model to capture more context and generate more detailed outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Computational Infrastructure:** The fine-tuning was carried out utilising a L4 GPU. Using more powerful hardware might greatly speed up the training process, allowing for the exploration of larger models with more parameters and the processing of longer input sequences. This enhanced processing capacity may contribute to better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperparameter Optimisation:** A more thorough examination of the hyperparameter space could improve the existing fine-tuning procedure. In particular, increasing the number of training epochs may offer the model with more opportunity to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the financial data, potentially leading to improved summarisation accuracy.\n"

        "Fine-tuning the LED model on the EDGAR finance dataset resulted in a considerable improvement in summarising long financial reports compared to a pre-trained BART model with input length constraints and a base LED model trained on a different domain (books). This emphasises the importance of both the LED architecture's capability for lengthy sequences and task-specific training. While the influence of the global attention mechanism needed to be studied further, the fine-tuned LED model had the highest summary ratings. To improve performance even further, future research should focus on increasing training data and computer resources for more extensive optimisation."

June 30, 2016 REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wigi4you, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wigi4you, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of as June 30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Respectfully submitted, Weinberg & Baer LLC Baltimore, Maryland September 27, 2016 WIGI4YOU, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2016 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose. Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas around the United States and Canada. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize the Company’s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements. Revenue recognition The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”. Revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues on sales of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement. The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price. If the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Advertising Advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Capital Stock The Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Income Taxes The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. NOTE B - GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above. NOTE C - COMMON STOCK On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. As of June 30, 2016 the Company has received $41,000 from investors for 1,640,000 shares of common stock to be issued. The shares were subscribed as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC to register and sell 2,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.025 per share. NOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On July 22, 2014, a Director of the company paid $555 to Thomas Puzzo towards his accounts payable due. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand. On February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds of $21,000. NOTE E - INCOME TAXES For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $17,566 at June 30, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2034. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes as follows: Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015: Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17,566 for federal income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of June 30, 2016. NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENT During August 2016, Company received $9,000 from investors for 360,000 shares of common stock to be issued. On September 21, 2016, Company issued 2,000,000 shares to various investors at a price of $0.025 per share against the share application money received.\"\"\"\n",

              "'The financial statement provided indicates that the company has been experiencing a loss since its inception. This means that the expenses have exceeded its revenues over the years, resulting in a negative net income. The company has incurred operating costs that have contributed to its overall financial performance. Additionally, the statement mentions that it has been incurring losses since its establishment on June 30.  Expenses mentioned in the statement refer to the costs incurred by the company in running its operations. These expenses include operating expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, and other overhead costs. It is important to note that these expenses are deducted from the revenue to calculate the company\\'s net income or loss for the specified period to determine the overall profitability of the business.   The statement also mentions liabilities related to debt securities bought with borrowed funds. Liabilities may include accounts payable, loans, accrued expenses, and long-term debts that need to be settled in the future. The mention of \"current liabilities\" suggests that they are obligations that are due within one year and are classified as of the specified date. In this case, the company owes $4,000 in current liabilities, indicating that it owes money that needs to be paid off within a relatively short period, usually within a year.'"
